			"contents": [
				"To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly novel. We've got it down to four words: \"Do what you love.\" But it's not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is complicated.",
				"The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.",
				"And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work.",
				"The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids. Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work. Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing. Much as we disliked school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.",
				"Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun. Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of them. Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing dodgeball? For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of kids instead of lying on a beach. You couldn't just do what you wanted.",
				"I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want. They may have to be made to work on certain things. But if we make kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more interesting stuff later. [1]",
				"Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it. I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous. It was like being told to use dry water. Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he meant work could literally be fun—fun like playing. It took me years to grasp that.",
				"Jobs",
				"By high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon. Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we would go to see them at work. It was always understood that they enjoyed what they did. In retrospect I think one may have: the private jet pilot. But I don't think the bank manager really did.",
				"The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was presumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed to. It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you despised your job, but a social faux-pas.",
				"Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do? The first sentence of this essay explains that. If you have to like something to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what they do. That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from. Just as houses all over America are full of chairs that are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed 250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of the attitudes of people who've done great things.",
				"What a recipe for alienation. By the time they reach an age to think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one's work. School has trained them to regard work as an unpleasant duty. Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork. And yet all the adults claim to like what they do. You can't blame kids for thinking \"I am not like these people; I am not suited to this world.\"",
				"Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught to regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not (necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around them are lying when they say they like what they do.",
				"The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents. If you take a boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so many people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that work is boring. [2] Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so unselfish. A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house. [3]",
				"It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living. Then the important question became not how to make money, but what to work on. Ideally these coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in the patent office) proved they weren't identical.",
				"The definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world, and in the process not to starve. But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large component of pain. Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun. Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.",
				"If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to notice if you're doing it wrong. That about sums up my experience of graduate school.",
				"Bounds",
				"How much are you supposed to like what you do? Unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too early. You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige—or sheer inertia.",
				"Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this second. Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first.",
				"It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do. There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked that much. If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer? Honestly, no.",
				"But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.",
				"Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.",
				"As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure. You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken. Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working. You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up. Then you want to do something else—even something mindless. But you don't regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.",
				"I put the lower bound there for practical reasons. If your work is not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems with procrastination. You'll have to force yourself to work, and when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.",
				"To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire. You have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool. This doesn't mean you have to make something. If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least, wow, that's pretty cool. What there has to be is a test.",
				"So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is reading books. Except for some books in math and the hard sciences, there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work. You have to do something with what you've read to feel productive.",
				"I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things that would make your friends say wow. But it probably wouldn't start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.",
				"Sirens",
				"What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends. You shouldn't worry about prestige. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world. When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know? [4]",
				"This is easy advice to give. It's hard to follow, especially when you're young. [5] Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.",
				"That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example. They like reading novels. They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes. What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist? But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.",
				"Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.",
				"Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious. If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. That's the recipe for getting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and so on. It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.",
				"Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other. Your opinions about what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.",
				"The other big force leading people astray is money. Money by itself is not that dangerous. When something pays well but is regarded with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal injury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it. That kind of work ends up being done by people who are \"just trying to make a living.\" (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say this.) The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in, say, corporate law, or medicine. A comparatively safe and prosperous career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting to someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really like.",
				"The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it—even if they had to work at another job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers would do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?",
				"This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds of academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect. Most good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver: people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies, and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs. Math would happen without math departments, but it is the existence of English majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity in the novels of Conrad. No one does that kind of thing for fun.",
				"The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money. It seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists. The kids think their parents are \"materialistic.\" Not necessarily. All parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves, simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards. If your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences.",
				"Discipline",
				"With such powerful forces leading us astray, it's not surprising we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on. Most people are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work = pain. Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige or money. How many even discover something they love to work on? A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.",
				"It's hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do. So don't underestimate this task. And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded yet. In fact, if you admit to yourself that you're discontented, you're a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial. If you're surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you find contemptible, odds are they're lying to themselves. Not necessarily, but probably.",
				"Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think—because the way to do great work is to find something you like so much that you don't have to force yourself to do it—finding work you love does usually require discipline. Some people are lucky enough to know what they want to do when they're 12, and just glide along as if they were on railroad tracks. But this seems the exception. More often people who do great things have careers with the trajectory of a ping-pong ball. They go to school to study A, drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after taking it up on the side.",
				"Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of energy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness. Are you dropping out, or boldly carving a new path? You often can't tell yourself. Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments early on, when they're trying to find their niche.",
				"Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest? One is to try to do a good job at whatever you're doing, even if you don't like it. Then at least you'll know you're not using dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy. Perhaps more importantly, you'll get into the habit of doing things well.",
				"Another test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you're actually writing.",
				"\"Always produce\" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. \"Always produce\" will discover your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.",
				"Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn't mean you get to work on it. That's a separate question. And if you're ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated by what seems possible. [6]",
				"It's painful to keep them apart, because it's painful to observe the gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their expectations. For example, if you asked random people on the street if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most would say something like \"Oh, I can't draw.\" This is more a statement of intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try. Because the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far. But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years. And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"",
				"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love—that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs. Really? How do you make them? In the US the only mechanism for forcing people to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn't been invoked for over 30 years. All we can do is encourage people to do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.",
				"If there's something people still won't do, it seems as if society just has to make do without. That's what happened with domestic servants. For millennia that was the canonical example of a job \"someone had to do.\" And yet in the mid twentieth century servants practically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just had to do without.",
				"So while there may be some things someone has to do, there's a good chance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken. Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no one were willing to do them.",
				"Two Routes",
				"There's another sense of \"not everyone can do work they love\" that's all too true, however. One has to make a living, and it's hard to get paid for doing work you love. There are two routes to that destination:",
				"The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don't.",
				"The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money to work on things you do.",
				"The organic route is more common. It happens naturally to anyone who does good work. A young architect has to take whatever work he can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position to pick and choose among projects. The disadvantage of this route is that it's slow and uncertain. Even tenure is not real freedom.",
				"The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you work for money at a time. At one extreme is the \"day job,\" where you work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what you love in your spare time. At the other extreme you work at something till you make enough not to have to work for money again.",
				"The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because it requires a deliberate choice. It's also more dangerous. Life tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job. Worse still, anything you work on changes you. If you work too long on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain. And the best paying jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.",
				"The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over obstacles. The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work. [7] The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you from architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music. If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you have more freedom of choice.",
				"Which route should you take? That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your lifetime) for what you want to do. If you're sure of the general area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route. But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.",
				"Don't decide too soon. Kids who know early what they want to do seem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math question before the other kids. They have an answer, certainly, but odds are it's wrong.",
				"A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantly about her job. When people applying to medical school ask her for advice, she wants to shake them and yell \"Don't do it!\" (But she never does.) How did she get into this fix? In high school she already wanted to be a doctor. And she is so ambitious and determined that she overcame every obstacle along the way—including, unfortunately, not liking it.",
				"Now she has a life chosen for her by a high-school kid.",
				"When you're young, you're given the impression that you'll get enough information to make each choice before you need to make it. But this is certainly not so with work. When you're deciding what to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information. Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are like. At best you may have a couple internships, but not all jobs offer internships, and those that do don't teach you much more about the work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.",
				"In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, you get better results if you use flexible media. So unless you're fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job career. That was probably part of the reason I chose computers. You can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it into any number of other kinds of work.",
				"It's also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many different things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like. Conversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerous because it teaches you so little about what you like. If you work hard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you'll quit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens when you quit and then discover that you don't actually like writing novels?",
				"Most people would say, I'd take that problem. Give me a million dollars and I'll figure out what to do. But it's harder than it looks. Constraints give your life shape. Remove them and most people have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who win lotteries or inherit money. Much as everyone thinks they want financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it, but those who like what they do. So a plan that promises freedom at the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as it seems.",
				"Whichever route you take, expect a struggle. Finding work you love is very difficult. Most people fail. Even if you succeed, it's rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or forties. But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more likely to arrive at it. If you know you can love work, you're in the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're practically there."

			"title": "The Asian American Quarter-Life Crisis",
			"headline": "In the 10 years since I graduated from college, I’ve had the same conversation hundreds of times.",
			"contents": [
				"In the 10 years since I graduated from college, I’ve had the same conversation hundreds of times:",
				"\"What are you doing now?\"",
				"\"I’m an engineer/a lawyer/a pharmacist/an analyst at [insert name of large bank here].\"",
				"\"Oh, cool!  Do you like it?\"",
				"[shrug] \"It’s work.\"",
				"Or maybe:",
				"\"Not really, but… I guess it’s okay for now….\"",
				"Or maybe just:",
				"\"No.\"",
				"I’ve had this conversation so many times that I feel like this problem is epidemic:  So many Asian Americans I know have great jobs.  So few of them enjoy their work.",
				"I’ve dubbed this the Asian American Quarter-Life Crisis: intelligent and hard-working twenty- and thirtysomethings in stable, well-paying jobs that they detest but don’t leave.",
				"If the conversation continues (and often it doesn’t, because the other person is depressed by it or just doesn’t want to talk about it), the reasons for staying in the job are sometimes predictable.  \"It pays the bills.\"  \"The economy is crap.\"  But what I hear most often is this: \"I don’t know what else I would do.\"",
				"***",
				"Working a job that you don’t like isn’t unique to Asian Americans, obviously — it’s a problem so common that complaining about it is cliche.  But I think this issue is especially pervasive in Asian American communities.  For one, Asian cultures tend to be risk-averse, to value knowing your place and not rocking the boat.  On top of that, our parents came to this country for the sake of financial security and stability, and they inculcated us with the same values.  Most of us have been raised to think about our futures for as long as we can remember.  It starts with math workbooks.  Gifted summer camps.  Endless SAT prep.  All for the sake of fabulous college applications, which lead us to the best universities.  The best internships.  The best (read: most lucrative, most prestigious, most stable) careers, which usually fall somewhere in the vicinity of medicine, law, engineering, and (corporate) business.",
				"In midst of all this striving for the best, there’s little to no attention paid to what we might actually enjoy.  That would be indulgent, if not completely unheard of.  There’s little concern in Asian cultures for personal strengths and weaknesses; there’s no such thing as someone who’s \"not a math person\" or \"not an science person,\" because excellence in any area can be attained through hard work.  There’s nothing that can’t be achieved through more repetitions or more discipline.  Failure to excel at something is not attributed to our unique dispositions; it’s attributed solely to laziness or lack of effort, and that is unacceptable.  As a result, we’re trained to excel at everything.  We become excellent at jumping through hoops and knocking down any task that’s placed before us. That’s what we end up enjoying, at least while we’re in school.  These are not terrible skills to have, mind you.  But the flip side is that as we’re trained be great at everything, there’s very little attention paid to what among those things we actually like.  Generally speaking, this is not on our parents’ radars at all, and as a result, it goes neglected on ours.",
				"The result of all of this: a generation of Asian Americans who are excellent at achieving but have no idea what they want to do.  (Or, if they do know, are reluctant to pursue it because it isn’t as stable or well-paid as their current jobs.)  A generation that is incredibly successful but, professionally speaking, not terribly happy.",
				"Not to say that there aren’t Asian Americans who, in the midst of racking up achievements, figured out and pursued what interested them.  And there are certainly Asian parents who are exceptions to the rule, who are actually interested in what their children want to do and support them regardless.  I have Asian American friends who are graphic designers, actors, community activists; who are rethinking math pedagogy for Teach for America and doing campus ministry; and yes, even a few who enjoy being doctors and programmers and brand managers.  Their numbers, however, are dwarfed by the scores of Asian Americans I know who would be much happier in other fields — engineers who should be teachers and filmmakers, lawyers who should be writers, doctors who should be chefs.  And, of course, those who have no idea what they should be doing.",
				"Also, I’m not trying to invalidate or trivialize how difficult this quarter-life crisis is.  It’s a crisis, after all, because there are significant pros and cons to all available options.  But I can’t help but wonder what kind of creative, innovative projects and careers Asian Americans would tackle if they weren’t confined — psychologically, financially, or culturally — to jobs they didn’t enjoy.  And how much happier and more fulfilled they might be as a result.",
				"***",
				"Of course, I draw not only from my peers’ experiences but also my own. I grew up as a little achieving machine.  My parents weren’t just Asian immigrants; they were Asian immigrants who came here to get PhDs and went on to become professors, so education was paramount in our family.  The value of education (and stability it would eventually bring me) was so strong that my mom didn’t even need to be a tiger mom; by elementary school, I had so deeply internalized it that she didn’t need to do anything to motivate me to achieve.  In high school, I cleaned up across the board — not only in math and science, the stereotypically Asian subjects my parents taught, but also in English and social studies.  I had to be the best at everything.  There was no excuse not to be.",
				"In the midst of all this achieving, I also figured out what I wanted to study:  Oddly enough, the recurring refrain of \"Why are you like that?  Like, the way you are?\" in My So-Called Life, which I watched obsessively in 7th grade, triggered an interest in psychology.  My parents were down with this, because they expected a doctorate degree, and whether it was in medicine or psychology, I would have tangible career options.  So I went off to college as a psych major.  Meanwhile, my Asian American friends swarmed to engineering and premed classes, spending long days in the chem lab or long nights in the computer lab, which they almost universally loathed.  I toiled with them for one semester, taking multivariable calculus and organic chemistry (\"to challenge myself,\" I said at the time, though in retrospect, I think I just had something to prove) before retiring from all things premed.  For the next 3 years, I looked at my peers with a mix of pity and smugness.  They mindlessly studied what their parents wanted them to study, but I was studying something I actually liked.",
				"I kept this chip on my shoulder for years — until I found myself midway through a PhD program and seriously questioning if I wanted to be there.  I found myself in the very position for which I had judged my peers:  I was pursuing a secure, well-paying career that my parents wanted for me but I wasn’t sure I wanted.  Meanwhile, the people in college I smirked at for their hapless pursuit of stable careers — they were no less happy than I was, but at least they were making great money.  All I was doing was accruing debt.",
				"All of this came to a head 4 years ago, when I started the full-time internship that made up my last year of grad school, and I realized that my worst fears had come true:  I had spent 5 years in school for a career I didn’t want.  I had endured more classes, papers, and exams than I could count; an exhausting master’s thesis and an even more grueling dissertation; countless hours stressing about clinical hours, data analyses, internship applications, and all the other work of grad school.  I was getting my first taste of what my life in this field would be like — a life I spent years doggedly pursuing — and I didn’t like it.",
				"I was also getting my first taste of what many of my peers had been experiencing for years.  Working at a job you hate SUCKS.  Like, REALLY sucks.  Getting up in the morning is terrible, because you’re tired and you don’t want to go to the job you loathe, and then you’re there for 8 hours — the entire time the sun is out — if not longer, and you come home and you’re exhausted and you have no time or energy to do the things you actually want to do.  And you have to do this AGAIN.  And AGAIN.  And AGAIN.  And a respite comes on Friday, if you’re not too tired to enjoy it, and then Sunday comes too quickly and you sink into your weekly funk because you have to repeat the whole cycle AGAIN.  It’s like being in hell.  All I ever thought about that year was my next day off, when I could maybe sneak in a sick day and just sleep….",
				"Meanwhile, the next hoop was being placed in front of me.  Announcements for post-docs started flooding my inbox almost the minute my internship started — post-docs that my peers were applying for, interviewing for, getting.  There was pressure all around me to swim with the current — but could I do it if I was so, you know, unhappy with what I was doing?  Could I really sign up for more of the same?",
				"I started peeling my fingers away, one by one.  I held out for half-time post-docs, which are virtually nonexistent, thinking that maybe I could do what I was trained to do part-time and use the remaining time to pursue something I actually liked.  The few half-time opportunities that materialized fizzled out quickly.  In the end, I was left with a gift:  I did not have a job in my field.  Or any job, for that matter.  I had no choice but to do something else — to maybe figure out what I really wanted to do.  At 28, with a PhD in a field I didn’t want to work in, I was about to embark on the task I should have started 10 years before.",
				"***",
				"I took a very different tack this time around:  Instead of setting a long-term goal and obstinately staying the course, no matter what data I collected along the way, I would look for jobs that interested me and try them.  If I liked them, I would continue; if not, I would quit.  And I would see what opportunities unfolded that way.  After years of meticulously planning my professional life, this strategy — one that involved working forward and not backward, in which my future would be determined by opportunities that may or may not arise — was terrifying.  But it was also thrilling — like stepping onto a tightrope without a 5-year plan to catch me.  And, well, I had seen how my previous strategy played out.  I didn’t think I could do much worse.",
				"So, new game plan in hand, I started my job hunt.  I got an adjunct professor position at my alma mater; aside from the absurd amounts of prep work and the occasional entitled student, I found that I really enjoyed teaching, and it was a much better fit for me than clinical work.  Then a friend from college asked if I would be interested in working with high school students, which I had done in undergrad and was happy to take up again.  That job also led to some consulting work, which I had never done before but turned out to be right up my alley.  Thus I patched together a professional life, running from meeting to class to meeting — but, in a dramatic change from the previous year, I loved going to work.  Each of my jobs felt meaningful, played to my strengths, and had far more awesome moments than terrible ones.  I finally got a taste for what it was like to do work that was life-giving, and it was fantastic.  On top of that, I found that my satisfaction at work trickled into every other area of my life; after a year of being a zombie, I was happy, well-rested, energetic.  I felt alive again.",
				"Then, a few months ago, we had to move for my husband’s job, and I found myself back at square one.  As wonderful as youth work and teaching were, I didn’t feel a strong need to continue either one.  So back I went to trying-and-seeing.  Two of my professors from grad school offered me a job as a consultant, helping millennials figure out what they want to do with their lives.  Given my experiences, both professional (therapy, assessment, working with students, consulting) and personal (knowing intimately how it felt to end up in the wrong career and to wonder what I was doing with my life), this felt like an excellent fit — and it was, for once, something I could see myself doing long-term.  I had also wanted for years to write more seriously — a desire that I had struggled to acknowledge, fearing that it sounded pretentious, frivolous, or both — and it appeared that I now had time to give that a shot.  But I also needed an income as I built up these lines of work, so I looked for yet another job.  I applied to work at a few independent bookstores, something I had always thought would be fun but never had the chance to try.  One took a chance and hired me, even though I was both incredibly overqualified and incredibly underqualified.  So I find myself splitting my time between three different gigs yet again.",
				"And lo and behold, I am happy, for the same reasons I was in my previous trifecta of employment.  Obviously, the situation isn’t perfect:  I spend every day shifting between very different tasks.  At the moment, I make significantly less than my peers from grad school, who are now licensed psychologists, and pretty much everyone I went to college with.  My resume makes no sense at all.  I’m almost 31, and I’ve made only the slightest headway into a career I want to have.  But for me, all of that pales in comparison to how it feels to be doing work that I actually enjoy.  After years of jumping through hoops because it was all I knew how to do, of achieving for the sake of achieving, I’m finally doing work that I find meaningful.  And it feels pretty awesome.  In a sharp contrast to my previous way of living, I have no idea what my life will look like in 5 years — but I’m content and fulfilled right now, and that feels like a good trade-off.",
				"***",
				"Now, I’m not saying that what I did is the right thing to do and that every Asian American who’s unhappy with their job should leave it immediately.  I am lucky to have no student loans or house payments or children to support, to have a husband who is entirely supportive and as eager to see me in a job I love as I am, to have parents who had ample warning about this sea change and accepted it with minimal resistance, and on and on and on.  I recognize that some people have children, parental demands, mortgages, and other constraints that keep them from making similar changes — and some have found a way to be content in the midst of less-than-thrilling careers.  I respect that.",
				"But in my case, I felt so dissatisfied with the path I was on that I needed to ask myself some serious questions about the choices I was making — and judging from all the conversations I’ve had in the last 10 years with other Asian Americans about their jobs, I don’t think I’m alone.  I don’t think that pursuing careers that are safe and stable is a bad thing by any means; having a consistent income, health insurance, and resources to live in a safe neighborhood with good schools is nothing to sneeze at.  But I worry that as a community, we hyperfocus on security and stability to the point where we don’t think to explore what could be life-giving and fulfilling for us.  And as a result, a lot of us walk around not very happy with our professional lives — which is to say, for most of our waking hours — and not really knowing how to change that.",
				"I don’t have any easy answers or one-size-fits-all solutions, but I do think we need to spend more time reflecting on our choices, both individually and collectively.  And I wonder what would happen if we allowed ourselves more room to explore.  I wonder what kinds of things we would pursue — and how much more fulfilled we could be.",
				"***",
				"A final thought:  If anything here has resonated with you, I’d like to hear your story, too.  If you left your career, if you decided to stay, if you’re trying to figure that out right now — what has your process been like?  What’s made it hard or easy for you to make your decision?  How will you advise your children, should you choose to have them?  I’m super-curious to hear."			],

				"'It takes courage to grow up and be who you really are.' — e.e. cummings",
				"About 6 months ago, I decided to quit my very good job at Google to explore a different way to live life. I had a loose plan of how I wanted to spend my time, but the main reason I left was that I couldn't stay. I couldn't put it into words at the time, but something inside of me was telling me I shouldn't continue down the career path I was on. I felt strongly that it wasn't getting me closer to where I wanted to be, though that destination was largely unknown, and I had to get off that road. Each month I stayed, I grew more anxious and, in turn, resentful. I could wait until I knew exactly which exit I was supposed to take, but I knew it would be harder to turn around as time went on, and what if I never knew which exit was right? The only thing of which I was certain was that no one was going to tell me how to get there; not my manager, not my co workers, not my friends, not my parents. I envisioned an older version of myself with a wonderful husband, beautiful kids, a mortgage and a crippling sense that I had missed my opportunity to dig deeper into what I really wanted out of life. So I swerved in January 2013 and took the next exit.",
				"When people ask me what it was like to leave, I liken my experience of leaving Google to breaking up with my college boyfriend. He was brilliant, good looking, respected, and everyone loved him — I even loved him — but he wasn't the one. It used to catch up with me on long bus rides my senior year, staring out the window, and I'd get a knot in the pit of my stomach. Realizing that I had to let him go was a slow and difficult process, but it was the right thing to do and I eventually mustered up the courage to break both of our hearts. I wasn't sure I would ever meet someone like him again, but leaving that relationship opened me up for so much more later on, and I continue to think of that decision as one of the most pivotal in my life. It took me several years to reach the same conclusion about corporate life at Google — it was almost unimaginable to give up a salary, a manager who treated me like family and co-workers I genuinely considered friends. I had worked so hard for it. I couldn't let it go, even though I was in many ways unhappy.",
				"When I sat down and really thought about why I was resisting, I realized something about myself that I didn't like, something that I'm ashamed to even admit now. The main reason I was resisting was because I would be giving up the safety and prestige associated with life as a Googler. When I reflected more, I realized that external recognition had unfortunately become a primary motivator for me. It started back in kindergarten when Mrs. Money told my Mom I was the brightest student she'd had in 40+ years of teaching. All my friends have stories like this — we were all those kids. Over time, being recognized for what I did became more exciting as the stakes grew higher (honor roll, getting into prep school, getting into Wellesley, getting an award in college, getting a prized internship, getting a job at Google). The problem I now faced was what to do when what I wanted to do next (give it all up) didn't come with many brownie points at all, except maybe that I was gutsy. Nothing had prepared me for that. In fact, the need for recognition was still so engrained in me that I leaned on my start up as a crutch during my exit from Google. 'I'm leaving to work on my start up idea.' That was shorter and more palatable than 'I'm taking time to slow down and better understand myself and what I want out of this life.'",
				"It was during my last promotion at work that I realized something was really off, more so than the dull anxiety I felt pretty consistently after Year 1 post-college. Year 1 was too much of a whirlwind to stop and think about what I was doing, between making money for the first time, meeting my incredible start class, going through training, being thrown into the deep end with clients. I fell in love with Google that year and I also fell in love with a Googler, so I was pretty distracted from asking larger questions about life. But what I noticed, years later, in my last promotion at Google, was that the incremental gains I was making in my role weren't making me incrementally happier. If anything, the promotion made me less happy because it made me feel like I was putting all my energy into something I wasn't even sure about. The money was nice, but it didn't change my lifestyle. I felt really guilty almost all the time. Wasn't Google supposed to be the best place to work? Wasn't I supposed to cherish my six figure salary, free meals, massages, etc? I did feel incredibly thankful, but I also felt like a jerk. The truth was I felt unfulfilled and I was scared to tell anyone.",
				"I wish my own inner voice had said, 'Hey Elle, this gig does have a lot of great things going for it, but maybe it's time to leave.' Instead it said, 'Hey Elle, everyone wants this, so you probably should too. Find a way to love it. Be good at it. Stop complaining. ' And so I did — I worked hard, I got sent to Tokyo for three months, I worked with exciting clients like Square, I led diversity initiatives in my office, I trained new team members. The truth is that I grew up at Google — it's where I learned to do good work. It was my MBA. But my heart wasn't in it anymore. I knew it, but I still couldn't leave. I had the power to change my life and I wouldn't do it. It wasn't my parents — my parents had always been supportive of me doing whatever I wanted, even if that meant leaving — it was me. It was my fear of failure that made me stay, my fear of what people would think. It was no one's pressure but my own. And that was the worst kind because it never went away. It was with me from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep, and sometimes in my dreams too. For years I had a recurring dream that I was being chased, jumping through windows and doors, but never getting further away from my chaser. In real life, I asked myself every day, why am I here? What am I doing? I felt like an impostor in my own life.",
				"My anxiety peaked at the end of 2012 and I decided to take a month off work around the holidays to see if simply not working would help me get clarity. It threw everyone off that I hadn't planned an elaborate European vacation with the four weeks I was taking. I told everyone I was staying at home in San Francisco to just 'live life.' I went to ballet most mornings, I went to the grocery store and cooked for myself (a novelty for Googlers), I started baking again, I read, I ran, I played guitar, I neglected email. Quite simply, I spent more time enjoying the small pleasures in life I never prioritized when working, hoping that a light would go off. I had fun, but there was no light much to my disappointment. Maybe I should have gone to Europe after all, I thought.",
				"And then, as my month off came to an end, I decided on a whim to go to Joshua Tree for New Year's with one of my close college friends, her boyfriend and a collection of their friends who lived in LA. As we were huddled around the campfire before midnight, in 20 degree weather, one of their friends began to ask me about myself. Almost everyone there was an artist of some sort, so I remember feeling shy about the fact I worked at a huge tech company. It was almost like admitting I worked for the IRS. He asked what I did for work and how long I'd been doing it and I told him. His response was, 'So you must really like it then to be there for so long. What about it? What's it like?' It felt like so many questions, so intrusive, but he was just being conversational. I remember saying something nice (most likely I said 'the people are great' which is true), but I remember feeling defensive, like I was being tested. In reality, that was all in my head, but that was my light going off…for the first time I was recognizing inauthenticity in myself. I couldn't stand it.",
				"After that conversation, I wandered away from the campfire for a few minutes to get a better look at the stars. The moon had never looked so big. I could hear old school hip hop from our camp in the distance, but I was surrounded by absolutely nothing and no one, and I felt free in the universe. It was that moment that I realized I was truly free to do whatever I wanted in this world and it was completely up to me to make it happen. It was my life, and I had to stop caring what people thought about it. If I wanted to bake, I should. If I wanted to write, I should. If I wanted to start a company, I should. If I wanted to do nothing, I should. If I wanted to fuck up for once, I should. I was probably only out there for a few minutes before someone tapped my shoulder to go back to the fire (it was so cold that night your pee froze as soon as it hit the ground), but it felt like an eternity. Maybe I would have reached this conclusion had I stayed in San Francisco, but I really believe it was the magic of being nowhere that did it. Being nowhere forced me to stay silent long enough to hear what I hadn't wanted to admit: I wasn't living authentically. When I returned to work, I gave my notice immediately. My explanation of what I was leaving to do (explore some hobbies, work on a few projects, bake more) confused everyone, but they were all fully supportive. Ironically and quite magically, the day I returned (which was also the day I gave notice), an award was sitting on my desk that I had won while I was out: 'Most Likely To Build A Start Up In The Next 5 Years.'",
				"Fast forward a few months and I'm still constantly bombarded with questions from family, friends, old co-workers and strangers about what life is like now. Sometimes it's glamorous; most times (like when I'm calculating how much time I have left before I run out of money) it's not. The truth is that going off the rails into the complete unknown is terrifying and it's lonely — some days I'm so paralyzed with fear about everything I can hardly do anything, but the other truth is a really important and big one: for the first time in my life, my identity is not 100% tied to my accomplishments, I care less about what people think of me and I spend more time on work that feels right. I am improving my ability to listen to my inner voice and not judge what it wants. I can question myself and answer truthfully.",
				"For me the answers to those questions led me to make some big changes in my work life, like giving up the job, exploring projects I used to think weren't worthy enough of my time (baking) and building a start up that is risky and deeply personal (Mend). In my personal life, it meant learning how to say no and better balance social obligations so that I could spend more time alone. It also meant making a physical move to Venice (the one in CA, not Italy) so that I could fulfill my dreams of a spacious 1br apartment to myself (which I couldn't shell out $3k for in SF), running on the beach every day and slowing down my pace of life from the frenetic and get-acquired-or-die San Francisco of 2013. It was hard to leave behind my best friends and give up the dizzyingly engaging Peter Pan life the Bay Area offers to 20 somethings, but when I walk along the beach alone on a warm summer night and watch the sunset behind the Santa Monica mountains, I know I'm finally home. Though I still only have vague dreams about the destination, I'm no longer constantly looking for the exit and that's how I know I'm on the right road. The caveat here is that studying hard my whole life and saving for almost 5 years afforded me the opportunity to have this time completely off payroll, but I think that everyone has the right and responsibility to go to Joshua Tree, metaphorically speaking. Everyone can dial everything back; the hard part is listening to what you have to say and doing something about it.",

But you can only invest so much money in the business. Where should you put your resources? Should you hire another baker? Buy another stove? Start your own rhubarb farm? You need to make a careful, data-based analysis of these options to figure out where the primary bottleneck is, and thus where you should concentrate your efforts.",
				"Business school types have a word for this sort of analysis: operations. Operations determines how products get manufactured and how services get delivered. Improving operations can cut costs, making the things you buy cheaper. It can speed processes, getting those things to you more swiftly. It can eliminate waste, doing a favor to the environment. You can thank (or blame) operations for the manner in which you're admitted into a hospital, screened at an airport, or served at a busy fast-food restaurant. ",
				"For the next few weeks, I will be exploring the world of operations management in a series for Slate. It is a world full of ingenuity, practicality, and even beauty. It draws on fields ranging from engineering and math to psychology and sociology. Simply put, operations is the science of making things run better. Once you start thinking like an operations geek, it can transform the way you think about everything, from your workplace to your commute to the way you make a PB&J.",
				"One important and enduring corner of the operations world—the one we'll be exploring today—is queuing theory. Queuing theory is the study of lines. All kinds of lines. The lines at supermarket checkouts, the lines at toll booths, the lines of people on hold waiting for someone, anyone, to pick up at the cable company’s 1-800 number. ",
				"MIT professor Dick Larson is perhaps America's foremost scholar of queuing theory. (This distinction has earned him the Bond-villain-ish nickname \"Dr. Queue.\") According to Larson, queuing theory got its start about 100 years ago in Denmark, necessitated by a booming new technology: the telephone.",
				"If your phone connected only to one other phone, it wouldn’t be very useful. What made telephony so valuable and popular was the ability to connect to thousands upon thousands of other phones. But this required a hub-and-spoke network, with calls coming into a switchbox and then being routed on their merry ways. ",
				"Back in 1909, calls were routed by operators using switching equipment. To maximize profits, telephone companies needed to know how precisely many operators and switches were necessary to handle call volumes. Too few operators and switches, and the calls would stack up, annoying waiting customers. Too many, and the company would be wasting money on excess labor and equipment. A Dane named Agner Krarup Erlang was assigned to study the problem. The equations he devised, says Larson, still get used today in operations—any time a manager needs to calculate the probability that a queue will build up given a certain volume of tasks and a certain amount of task-accomplishing resources.",
				"Corporate call centers these days tweak their algorithms to achieve similar but slightly more complicated goals. For instance, the highest paid service representatives at the call center are trained to handle very complex interactions with customers, while the lowest paid reps are qualified for only the most basic tasks. The call center attempts to optimize the distribution of incoming calls so that you’re sent to the lowest-paid rep who is still capable of addressing your complaint, freeing up the more expensive reps to solve the thornier problems. This is why you’re always being asked to describe your problem by punching numbers on the keyboard before you talk to a human being. Which in itself raises another operations challenge: how to get maximum information from the caller without ticking her off so much that she hangs up the phone in anger after her seventh keypad touch. ",
				"Though queuing math hasn’t changed a ton since 1909, this kind of queuing psychology has. According to Larson, since the mid-20th century, queuing theory has been more about feelings than formulas. For example: Midcentury New York featured a rush-hour crisis—not out on the roads, but inside office tower lobbies. There weren’t enough elevators to handle the peak crowds. Complaints were mounting. \"One solution would have been to dynamite the buildings and build more elevator shafts,\" says Larson. \"But someone figured out the real problem isn’t just the duration of a delay. It’s how you experience that duration.\" Some buildings installed floor-to-ceiling mirrors near the elevators and, entertained by their own reflections and by the flirting that sometimes ensued, people stopped complaining quite as much about the wait time.",
				"There are three givens of human nature that queuing psychologists must address: 1) We get bored when we wait in line. 2) We really hate it when we expect a short wait and then get a long one. 3) We really, really hate it when someone shows up after us but gets served before us. ",
				"The boredom issue has been tackled in myriad ways—from the mirrors next to elevator banks to the TVs in dentist’s waiting rooms. Larson mentions a clever solution from the Manhattan Savings Bank, which once hired a concert pianist to play in its lobby as customers waited for tellers. \"But Disney has been the absolute master of this aspect of queue psychology,\" says Larson. \"You might wait 45 minutes for an 8-minute ride at Disney World. But they’ll make you feel like the ride has started while you’re still on line. They build excitement and provide all kinds of diversions in the queue channel.\" Video screens tease the thrills ahead, and a series of varied chambers that the queue moves through creates a sense of progress. Another solution: those buzzing pagers that restaurants in malls sometimes give you while you’re waiting for a table. Instead of focusing on the misery of the wait, you can go off and entertain yourself—secure in the knowledge that you’ll be alerted when it’s your turn.",
				"How to play the expectations game? Studies show that we’re much more patient when we’re given an idea of how long we’ll be waiting, instead of wondering whether it will be three minutes or three hours. So, for example, some New York City subway platforms now feature digital displays featuring estimated arrival times for the next few trains. But again, Disney is the master. It posts estimated wait times next to various spots in its long queues—but, according to Larson, it pads the times so you always get to the head of the line more quickly than you’d expected: \"You think, ‘We’re 10 minutes ahead of schedule!’ and so you’re happy.\" ",
				"Perhaps the most emotional issue in the world of queuing is the human quest for fairness. \"When we see people arrive after us and get served before us we get very angry,\" says Larson. \"We can remember it for days, sometimes. And there have been incidents of ‘queue rage.’ People have drawn knives and guns.\"",
				"Sometimes we will make exceptions. We seem to be OK with the idea of an express lane at the supermarket—someone buying one roll of paper towels shouldn’t be forced to wait behind someone buying a full cart of groceries. We also allow for differing priorities at an ER, with more critical cases being admitted first even if they showed up last. ",
				"But in most situations, we demand social fairness. No one is more important than anyone else, and everyone should be served in the order he or she arrived. No doubt you’ve experienced mild queue rage when you choose the wrong line at a fast food counter or a drug store, watching people in the other lines zoom ahead of you.",
				"To solve this problem, some genius (Wendy’s, American Airlines, and Citibank are among the companies that claim to be originators) invented the serpentine line. The serpentine line funnels all customers into one big snaking queue, demarcated by ropes or barriers. When you reach the head of the queue, you are directed to the next available server, or teller, or customs official. The serpentine line isn’t always faster than a simple scrum before an array of cash registers. But it offers important solace: You absolutely never have to see someone arrive after you and get served before you.",
				"Larson says he was once at a queuing theory conference where the hotel checkout line became quite long and was populated mainly by queuing theorists. \"We insisted on forming our own serpentine line,\" he says. \"The lobby wasn’t designed for it and it looked extremely messy. The hotel manager was unhappy. If we’d just dispersed into six parallel lines at the checkout desk the wait might have been shorter and less chaotic. But it would have been less fair.\""

"EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO my job as the first woman director of policy planning at the State Department, a foreign-policy dream job that traces its origins back to George Kennan, I found myself in New York, at the United Nations' annual assemblage of every foreign minister and head of state in the world. On a Wednesday evening, President and Mrs. Obama hosted a glamorous reception at the American Museum of Natural History. I sipped champagne, greeted foreign dignitaries, and mingled. But I could not stop thinking about my 14-year-old son, who had started eighth grade three weeks earlier and was already resuming what had become his pattern of skipping homework, disrupting classes, failing math, and tuning out any adult who tried to reach him. Over the summer, we had barely spoken to each other—or, more accurately, he had barely spoken to me. And the previous spring I had received several urgent phone calls—invariably on the day of an important meeting—that required me to take the first train from Washington, D.C., where I worked, back to Princeton, New Jersey, where he lived. My husband, who has always done everything possible to support my career, took care of him and his 12-year-old brother during the week; outside of those midweek emergencies, I came home only on weekends.",
"As the evening wore on, I ran into a colleague who held a senior position in the White House. She has two sons exactly my sons' ages, but she had chosen to move them from California to D.C. when she got her job, which meant her husband commuted back to California regularly. I told her how difficult I was finding it to be away from my son when he clearly needed me. Then I said, \"When this is over, I'm going to write an op-ed titled 'Women Can't Have It All.'\"",
"She was horrified. \"You can't write that,\" she said. \"You, of all people.\" What she meant was that such a statement, coming from a high-profile career woman—a role model—would be a terrible signal to younger generations of women. By the end of the evening, she had talked me out of it, but for the remainder of my stint in Washington, I was increasingly aware that the feminist beliefs on which I had built my entire career were shifting under my feet. I had always assumed that if I could get a foreign-policy job in the State Department or the White House while my party was in power, I would stay the course as long as I had the opportunity to do work I loved. But in January 2011, when my two-year public-service leave from Princeton University was up, I hurried home as fast as I could.",
"A rude epiphany hit me soon after I got there. When people asked why I had left government, I explained that I'd come home not only because of Princeton's rules (after two years of leave, you lose your tenure), but also because of my desire to be with my family and my conclusion that juggling high-level government work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible. I have not exactly left the ranks of full-time career women: I teach a full course load; write regular print and online columns on foreign policy; give 40 to 50 speeches a year; appear regularly on TV and radio; and am working on a new academic book. But I routinely got reactions from other women my age or older that ranged from disappointed (\"It's such a pity that you had to leave Washington\") to condescending (\"I wouldn't generalize from your experience. I've never had to compromise, and my kids turned out great\").",
"The first set of reactions, with the underlying assumption that my choice was somehow sad or unfortunate, was irksome enough. But it was the second set of reactions—those implying that my parenting and/or my commitment to my profession were somehow substandard—that triggered a blind fury. Suddenly, finally, the penny dropped. All my life, I'd been on the other side of this exchange. I'd been the woman smiling the faintly superior smile while another woman told me she had decided to take some time out or pursue a less competitive career track so that she could spend more time with her family. I'd been the woman congratulating herself on her unswerving commitment to the feminist cause, chatting smugly with her dwindling number of college or law-school friends who had reached and maintained their place on the highest rungs of their profession. I'd been the one telling young women at my lectures that you can have it all and do it all, regardless of what field you are in. Which means I'd been part, albeit unwittingly, of making millions of women feel that they are to blame if they cannot manage to rise up the ladder as fast as men and also have a family and an active home life (and be thin and beautiful to boot).",
"Last spring, I flew to Oxford to give a public lecture. At the request of a young Rhodes Scholar I know, I'd agreed to talk to the Rhodes community about \"work-family balance.\" I ended up speaking to a group of about 40 men and women in their mid-20s. What poured out of me was a set of very frank reflections on how unexpectedly hard it was to do the kind of job I wanted to do as a high government official and be the kind of parent I wanted to be, at a demanding time for my children (even though my husband, an academic, was willing to take on the lion's share of parenting for the two years I was in Washington). I concluded by saying that my time in office had convinced me that further government service would be very unlikely while my sons were still at home. The audience was rapt, and asked many thoughtful questions. One of the first was from a young woman who began by thanking me for \"not giving just one more fatuous 'You can have it all' talk.\" Just about all of the women in that room planned to combine careers and family in some way. But almost all assumed and accepted that they would have to make compromises that the men in their lives were far less likely to have to make.",
"The striking gap between the responses I heard from those young women (and others like them) and the responses I heard from my peers and associates prompted me to write this article. Women of my generation have clung to the feminist credo we were raised with, even as our ranks have been steadily thinned by unresolvable tensions between family and career, because we are determined not to drop the flag for the next generation. But when many members of the younger generation have stopped listening, on the grounds that glibly repeating \"you can have it all\" is simply airbrushing reality, it is time to talk.",
"I still strongly believe that women can \"have it all\" (and that men can too). I believe that we can \"have it all at the same time.\" But not today, not with the way America's economy and society are currently structured. My experiences over the past three years have forced me to confront a number of uncomfortable facts that need to be widely acknowledged—and quickly changed.",
"BEFORE MY SERVICE in government, I'd spent my career in academia: as a law professor and then as the dean of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Both were demanding jobs, but I had the ability to set my own schedule most of the time. I could be with my kids when I needed to be, and still get the work done. I had to travel frequently, but I found I could make up for that with an extended period at home or a family vacation.",
"I knew that I was lucky in my career choice, but I had no idea how lucky until I spent two years in Washington within a rigid bureaucracy, even with bosses as understanding as Hillary Clinton and her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills. My workweek started at 4:20 on Monday morning, when I got up to get the 5:30 train from Trenton to Washington. It ended late on Friday, with the train home. In between, the days were crammed with meetings, and when the meetings stopped, the writing work began—a never-ending stream of memos, reports, and comments on other people's drafts. For two years, I never left the office early enough to go to any stores other than those open 24 hours, which meant that everything from dry cleaning to hair appointments to Christmas shopping had to be done on weekends, amid children's sporting events, music lessons, family meals, and conference calls. I was entitled to four hours of vacation per pay period, which came to one day of vacation a month. And I had it better than many of my peers in D.C.; Secretary Clinton deliberately came in around 8 a.m. and left around 7 p.m., to allow her close staff to have morning and evening time with their families (although of course she worked earlier and later, from home).",
"In short, the minute I found myself in a job that is typical for the vast majority of working women (and men), working long hours on someone else's schedule, I could no longer be both the parent and the professional I wanted to be—at least not with a child experiencing a rocky adolescence. I realized what should have perhaps been obvious: having it all, at least for me, depended almost entirely on what type of job I had. The flip side is the harder truth: having it all was not possible in many types of jobs, including high government office—at least not for very long.",
"I am hardly alone in this realization. Michèle Flournoy stepped down after three years as undersecretary of defense for policy, the third-highest job in the department, to spend more time at home with her three children, two of whom are teenagers. Karen Hughes left her position as the counselor to President George W. Bush after a year and a half in Washington to go home to Texas for the sake of her family. Mary Matalin, who spent two years as an assistant to Bush and the counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney before stepping down to spend more time with her daughters, wrote: \"Having control over your schedule is the only way that women who want to have a career and a family can make it work.\"",
"Yet the decision to step down from a position of power—to value family over professional advancement, even for a time—is directly at odds with the prevailing social pressures on career professionals in the United States. One phrase says it all about current attitudes toward work and family, particularly among elites. In Washington, \"leaving to spend time with your family\" is a euphemism for being fired. This understanding is so ingrained that when Flournoy announced her resignation last December, TheNew York Times covered her decision as follows:",
"Ms. Flournoy's announcement surprised friends and a number of Pentagon officials, but all said they took her reason for resignation at face value and not as a standard Washington excuse for an official who has in reality been forced out. \"I can absolutely and unequivocally state that her decision to step down has nothing to do with anything other than her commitment to her family,\" said Doug Wilson, a top Pentagon spokesman. \"She has loved this job and people here love her.",
"Think about what this \"standard Washington excuse\" implies: it is so unthinkable that an official would actually step down to spend time with his or her family that this must be a cover for something else. How could anyone voluntarily leave the circles of power for the responsibilities of parenthood? Depending on one's vantage point, it is either ironic or maddening that this view abides in the nation's capital, despite the ritual commitments to \"family values\" that are part of every political campaign. Regardless, this sentiment makes true work-life balance exceptionally difficult. But it cannot change unless top women speak out.",
"Only recently have I begun to appreciate the extent to which many young professional women feel under assault by women my age and older. After I gave a recent speech in New York, several women in their late 60s or early 70s came up to tell me how glad and proud they were to see me speaking as a foreign-policy expert. A couple of them went on, however, to contrast my career with the path being traveled by \"younger women today.\" One expressed dismay that many younger women \"are just not willing to get out there and do it.\" Said another, unaware of the circumstances of my recent job change: \"They think they have to choose between having a career and having a family.\"",
"A similar assumption underlies Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's widely publicized 2011 commencement speech at Barnard, and her earlier TED talk, in which she lamented the dismally small number of women at the top and advised young women not to \"leave before you leave.\" When a woman starts thinking about having children, Sandberg said, \"she doesn't raise her hand anymore … She starts leaning back.\" Although couched in terms of encouragement, Sandberg's exhortation contains more than a note of reproach. We who have made it to the top, or are striving to get there, are essentially saying to the women in the generation behind us: \"What's the matter with you?\"",
"They have an answer that we don't want to hear. After the speech I gave in New York, I went to dinner with a group of 30-somethings. I sat across from two vibrant women, one of whom worked at the UN and the other at a big New York law firm. As nearly always happens in these situations, they soon began asking me about work-life balance. When I told them I was writing this article, the lawyer said, \"I look for role models and can't find any.\" She said the women in her firm who had become partners and taken on management positions had made tremendous sacrifices, \"many of which they don't even seem to realize … They take two years off when their kids are young but then work like crazy to get back on track professionally, which means that they see their kids when they are toddlers but not teenagers, or really barely at all.\" Her friend nodded, mentioning the top professional women she knew, all of whom essentially relied on round-the-clock nannies. Both were very clear that they did not want that life, but could not figure out how to combine professional success and satisfaction with a real commitment to family.",
"I realize that I am blessed to have been born in the late 1950s instead of the early 1930s, as my mother was, or the beginning of the 20th century, as my grandmothers were. My mother built a successful and rewarding career as a professional artist largely in the years after my brothers and I left home—and after being told in her 20s that she could not go to medical school, as her father had done and her brother would go on to do, because, of course, she was going to get married. I owe my own freedoms and opportunities to the pioneering generation of women ahead of me—the women now in their 60s, 70s, and 80s who faced overt sexism of a kind I see only when watching Mad Men, and who knew that the only way to make it as a woman was to act exactly like a man. To admit to, much less act on, maternal longings would have been fatal to their careers.",
"But precisely thanks to their progress, a different kind of conversation is now possible. It is time for women in leadership positions to recognize that although we are still blazing trails and breaking ceilings, many of us are also reinforcing a falsehood: that \"having it all\" is, more than anything, a function of personal determination. As Kerry Rubin and Lia Macko, the authors of Midlife Crisis at 30, their cri de coeur for Gen-X and Gen-Y women, put it:",
"What we discovered in our research is that while the empowerment part of the equation has been loudly celebrated, there has been very little honest discussion among women of our age about the real barriers and flaws that still exist in the system despite the opportunities we inherited.",
"I am well aware that the majority of American women face problems far greater than any discussed in this article. I am writing for my demographic—highly educated, well-off women who are privileged enough to have choices in the first place. We may not have choices about whether to do paid work, as dual incomes have become indispensable. But we have choices about the type and tempo of the work we do. We are the women who could be leading, and who should be equally represented in the leadership ranks.",
"Millions of other working women face much more difficult life circumstances. Some are single mothers; many struggle to find any job; others support husbands who cannot find jobs. Many cope with a work life in which good day care is either unavailable or very expensive; school schedules do not match work schedules; and schools themselves are failing to educate their children. Many of these women are worrying not about having it all, but rather about holding on to what they do have. And although women as a group have made substantial gains in wages, educational attainment, and prestige over the past three decades, the economists Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson have shown that women are less happy today than their predecessors were in 1972, both in absolute terms and relative to men.",
"The best hope for improving the lot of all women, and for closing what Wolfers and Stevenson call a \"new gender gap\"—measured by well-being rather than wages—is to close the leadership gap: to elect a woman president and 50 women senators; to ensure that women are equally represented in the ranks of corporate executives and judicial leaders. Only when women wield power in sufficient numbers will we create a society that genuinely works for all women. That will be a society that works for everyone.",
"The Half-Truths We Hold Dear",
"Let's briefly examine the stories we tell ourselves, the clichés that I and many other women typically fall back on when younger women ask us how we have managed to \"have it all.\" They are not necessarily lies, but at best partial truths. We must clear them out of the way to make room for a more honest and productive discussion about real solutions to the problems faced by professional women.",
"It's possible if you are just committed enough.",
"Our usual starting point, whether we say it explicitly or not, is that having it all depends primarily on the depth and intensity of a woman's commitment to her career. That is precisely the sentiment behind the dismay so many older career women feel about the younger generation. They are not committed enough, we say, to make the trade-offs and sacrifices that the women ahead of them made.",
"Yet instead of chiding, perhaps we should face some basic facts. Very few women reach leadership positions. The pool of female candidates for any top job is small, and will only grow smaller if the women who come after us decide to take time out, or drop out of professional competition altogether, to raise children. That is exactly what has Sheryl Sandberg so upset, and rightly so. In her words, \"Women are not making it to the top. A hundred and ninety heads of state; nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. In the corporate sector, [the share of] women at the top—C-level jobs, board seats—tops out at 15, 16 percent.\"",
"Can \"insufficient commitment\" even plausibly explain these numbers? To be sure, the women who do make it to the top are highly committed to their profession. On closer examination, however, it turns out that most of them have something else in common: they are genuine superwomen. Consider the number of women recently in the top ranks in Washington—Susan Rice, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Michelle Gavin, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle—who are Rhodes Scholars. Samantha Power, another senior White House official, won a Pulitzer Prize at age 32. Or consider Sandberg herself, who graduated with the prize given to Harvard's top student of economics. These women cannot possibly be the standard against which even very talented professional women should measure themselves. Such a standard sets up most women for a sense of failure.",
"What's more, among those who have made it to the top, a balanced life still is more elusive for women than it is for men. A simple measure is how many women in top positions have children compared with their male colleagues. Every male Supreme Court justice has a family. Two of the three female justices are single with no children. And the third, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, began her career as a judge only when her younger child was almost grown. The pattern is the same at the National Security Council: Condoleezza Rice, the first and only woman national-security adviser, is also the only national-security adviser since the 1950s not to have a family.",
"The line of high-level women appointees in the Obama administration is one woman deep. Virtually all of us who have stepped down have been succeeded by men; searches for women to succeed men in similar positions come up empty. Just about every woman who could plausibly be tapped is already in government. The rest of the foreign-policy world is not much better; Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, recently surveyed the best data he could find across the government, the military, the academy, and think tanks, and found that women hold fewer than 30 percent of the senior foreign-policy positions in each of these institutions.",
"These numbers are all the more striking when we look back to the 1980s, when women now in their late 40s and 50s were coming out of graduate school, and remember that our classes were nearly 50-50 men and women. We were sure then that by now, we would be living in a 50-50 world. Something derailed that dream.",
"Sandberg thinks that \"something\" is an \"ambition gap\"—that women do not dream big enough. I am all for encouraging young women to reach for the stars. But I fear that the obstacles that keep women from reaching the top are rather more prosaic than the scope of their ambition. My longtime and invaluable assistant, who has a doctorate and juggles many balls as the mother of teenage twins, e-mailed me while I was working on this article: \"You know what would help the vast majority of women with work/family balance? MAKE SCHOOL SCHEDULES MATCH WORK SCHEDULES.\" The present system, she noted, is based on a society that no longer exists—one in which farming was a major occupation and stay-at-home moms were the norm. Yet the system hasn't changed.",
"Consider some of the responses of women interviewed by Zenko about why \"women are significantly underrepresented in foreign policy and national security positions in government, academia, and think tanks.\" Juliette Kayyem, who served as an assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2011 and now writes a foreign-policy and national-security column for The Boston Globe, told Zenko that among other reasons,",
"the basic truth is also this: the travel sucks. As my youngest of three children is now 6, I can look back at the years when they were all young and realize just how disruptive all the travel was. There were also trips I couldn't take because I was pregnant or on leave, the conferences I couldn't attend because (note to conference organizers: weekends are a bad choice) kids would be home from school, and the various excursions that were offered but just couldn't be managed.",
"Jolynn Shoemaker, the director of Women in International Security, agreed: \"Inflexible schedules, unrelenting travel, and constant pressure to be in the office are common features of these jobs.\"",
"These \"mundane\" issues—the need to travel constantly to succeed, the conflicts between school schedules and work schedules, the insistence that work be done in the office—cannot be solved by exhortations to close the ambition gap. I would hope to see commencement speeches that finger America's social and business policies, rather than women's level of ambition, in explaining the dearth of women at the top. But changing these policies requires much more than speeches. It means fighting the mundane battles—every day, every year—in individual workplaces, in legislatures, and in the media.",
"It's possible if you marry the right person.",
"Sandberg's second message in her Barnard commencement address was: \"The most important career decision you're going to make is whether or not you have a life partner and who that partner is.\" Lisa Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, recently drove that message home to an audience of Princeton students and alumni gathered to hear her acceptance speech for the James Madison Medal. During the Q&A session, an audience member asked her how she managed her career and her family. She laughed and pointed to her husband in the front row, saying: \"There's my work-life balance.\" I could never have had the career I have had without my husband, Andrew Moravcsik, who is a tenured professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton. Andy has spent more time with our sons than I have, not only on homework, but also on baseball, music lessons, photography, card games, and more. When each of them had to bring in a foreign dish for his fourth-grade class dinner, Andy made his grandmother's Hungarian palacsinta; when our older son needed to memorize his lines for a lead role in a school play, he turned to Andy for help.",
"Still, the proposition that women can have high-powered careers as long as their husbands or partners are willing to share the parenting load equally (or disproportionately) assumes that most women will feel as comfortable as men do about being away from their children, as long as their partner is home with them. In my experience, that is simply not the case.",
"Here I step onto treacherous ground, mined with stereotypes. From years of conversations and observations, however, I've come to believe that men and women respond quite differently when problems at home force them to recognize that their absence is hurting a child, or at least that their presence would likely help. I do not believe fathers love their children any less than mothers do, but men do seem more likely to choose their job at a cost to their family, while women seem more likely to choose their family at a cost to their job.",
"Many factors determine this choice, of course. Men are still socialized to believe that their primary family obligation is to be the breadwinner; women, to believe that their primary family obligation is to be the caregiver. But it may be more than that. When I described the choice between my children and my job to Senator Jeanne Shaheen, she said exactly what I felt: \"There's really no choice.\" She wasn't referring to social expectations, but to a maternal imperative felt so deeply that the \"choice\" is reflexive.",
"Men and women also seem to frame the choice differently. In Midlife Crisis at 30, Mary Matalin recalls her days working as President Bush's assistant and Vice President Cheney's counselor:",
"Even when the stress was overwhelming—those days when I'd cry in the car on the way to work, asking myself \"Why am I doing this??\"—I always knew the answer to that question: I believe in this president.",
"But Matalin goes on to describe her choice to leave in words that are again uncannily similar to the explanation I have given so many people since leaving the State Department:",
"I finally asked myself, \"Who needs me more?\" And that's when I realized, it's somebody else's turn to do this job. I'm indispensable to my kids, but I'm not close to indispensable to the White House.",
"To many men, however, the choice to spend more time with their children, instead of working long hours on issues that affect many lives, seems selfish. Male leaders are routinely praised for having sacrificed their personal life on the altar of public or corporate service. That sacrifice, of course, typically involves their family. Yet their children, too, are trained to value public service over private responsibility. At the diplomat Richard Holbrooke's memorial service, one of his sons told the audience that when he was a child, his father was often gone, not around to teach him to throw a ball or to watch his games. But as he grew older, he said, he realized that Holbrooke's absence was the price of saving people around the world—a price worth paying.",
"It is not clear to me that this ethical framework makes sense for society. Why should we want leaders who fall short on personal responsibilities? Perhaps leaders who invested time in their own families would be more keenly aware of the toll their public choices—on issues from war to welfare—take on private lives. (Kati Marton, Holbrooke's widow and a noted author, says that although Holbrooke adored his children, he came to appreciate the full importance of family only in his 50s, at which point he became a very present parent and grandparent, while continuing to pursue an extraordinary public career.) Regardless, it is clear which set of choices society values more today. Workers who put their careers first are typically rewarded; workers who choose their families are overlooked, disbelieved, or accused of unprofessionalism.",
"In sum, having a supportive mate may well be a necessary condition if women are to have it all, but it is not sufficient. If women feel deeply that turning down a promotion that would involve more travel, for instance, is the right thing to do, then they will continue to do that. Ultimately, it is society that must change, coming to value choices to put family ahead of work just as much as those to put work ahead of family. If we really valued those choices, we would value the people who make them; if we valued the people who make them, we would do everything possible to hire and retain them; if we did everything possible to allow them to combine work and family equally over time, then the choices would get a lot easier.",
"It's possible if you sequence it right.",
"Young women should be wary of the assertion \"You can have it all; you just can't have it all at once.\" This 21st-century addendum to the original line is now proffered by many senior women to their younger mentees. To the extent that it means, in the words of one working mother, \"I'm going to do my best and I'm going to keep the long term in mind and know that it's not always going to be this hard to balance,\" it is sound advice. But to the extent that it means that women can have it all if they just find the right sequence of career and family, it's cheerfully wrong.",
"The most important sequencing issue is when to have children. Many of the top women leaders of the generation just ahead of me—Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, Patricia Wald, Nannerl Keohane—had their children in their 20s and early 30s, as was the norm in the 1950s through the 1970s. A child born when his mother is 25 will finish high school when his mother is 43, an age at which, with full-time immersion in a career, she still has plenty of time and energy for advancement.",
"Yet this sequence has fallen out of favor with many high-potential women, and understandably so. People tend to marry later now, and anyway, if you have children earlier, you may have difficulty getting a graduate degree, a good first job, and opportunities for advancement in the crucial early years of your career. Making matters worse, you will also have less income while raising your children, and hence less ability to hire the help that can be indispensable to your juggling act.",
"When I was the dean, the Woodrow Wilson School created a program called Pathways to Public Service, aimed at advising women whose children were almost grown about how to go into public service, and many women still ask me about the best \"on-ramps\" to careers in their mid-40s. Honestly, I'm not sure what to tell most of them. Unlike the pioneering women who entered the workforce after having children in the 1970s, these women are competing with their younger selves. Government and NGO jobs are an option, but many careers are effectively closed off. Personally, I have never seen a woman in her 40s enter the academic market successfully, or enter a law firm as a junior associate, Alicia Florrick of The Good Wife notwithstanding.",
"These considerations are why so many career women of my generation chose to establish themselves in their careers first and have children in their mid-to-late 30s. But that raises the possibility of spending long, stressful years and a small fortune trying to have a baby. I lived that nightmare: for three years, beginning at age 35, I did everything possible to conceive and was frantic at the thought that I had simply left having a biological child until it was too late.",
"And when everything does work out? I had my first child at 38 (and counted myself blessed) and my second at 40. That means I will be 58 when both of my children are out of the house. What's more, it means that many peak career opportunities are coinciding precisely with their teenage years, when, experienced parents advise, being available as a parent is just as important as in the first years of a child's life.",
"Many women of my generation have found themselves, in the prime of their careers, saying no to opportunities they once would have jumped at and hoping those chances come around again later. Many others who have decided to step back for a while, taking on consultant positions or part-time work that lets them spend more time with their children (or aging parents), are worrying about how long they can \"stay out\" before they lose the competitive edge they worked so hard to acquire.",
"Given the way our work culture is oriented today, I recommend establishing yourself in your career first but still trying to have kids before you are 35—or else freeze your eggs, whether you are married or not. You may well be a more mature and less frustrated parent in your 30s or 40s; you are also more likely to have found a lasting life partner. But the truth is, neither sequence is optimal, and both involve trade-offs that men do not have to make.",
"You should be able to have a family if you want one—however and whenever your life circumstances allow—and still have the career you desire. If more women could strike this balance, more women would reach leadership positions. And if more women were in leadership positions, they could make it easier for more women to stay in the workforce. The rest of this essay details how.",
"Changing the Culture of Face Time",
"Back in the Reagan administration, a New York Times story about the ferociously competitive budget director Dick Darman reported, \"Mr. Darman sometimes managed to convey the impression that he was the last one working in the Reagan White House by leaving his suit coat on his chair and his office light burning after he left for home.\" (Darman claimed that it was just easier to leave his suit jacket in the office so he could put it on again in the morning, but his record of psychological manipulation suggests otherwise.)",
"The culture of \"time macho\"—a relentless competition to work harder, stay later, pull more all-nighters, travel around the world and bill the extra hours that the international date line affords you—remains astonishingly prevalent among professionals today. Nothing captures the belief that more time equals more value better than the cult of billable hours afflicting large law firms across the country and providing exactly the wrong incentives for employees who hope to integrate work and family. Yet even in industries that don't explicitly reward sheer quantity of hours spent on the job, the pressure to arrive early, stay late, and be available, always, for in-person meetings at 11 a.m. on Saturdays can be intense. Indeed, by some measures, the problem has gotten worse over time: a study by the Center for American Progress reports that nationwide, the share of all professionals—women and men—working more than 50 hours a week has increased since the late 1970s.",
"But more time in the office does not always mean more \"value added\"—and it does not always add up to a more successful organization. In 2009, Sandra Pocharski, a senior female partner at Monitor Group and the head of the firm's Leadership and Organization practice, commissioned a Harvard Business School professor to assess the factors that helped or hindered women's effectiveness and advancement at Monitor. The study found that the company's culture was characterized by an \"always on\" mode of working, often without due regard to the impact on employees. Pocharski observed:",
"Clients come first, always, and sometimes burning the midnight oil really does make the difference between success and failure. But sometimes we were just defaulting to behavior that overloaded our people without improving results much, if at all. We decided we needed managers to get better at distinguishing between these categories, and to recognize the hidden costs of assuming that \"time is cheap.\" When that time doesn't add a lot of value and comes at a high cost to talented employees, who will leave when the personal cost becomes unsustainable—well, that is clearly a bad outcome for everyone.",
"I have worked very long hours and pulled plenty of all-nighters myself over the course of my career, including a few nights on my office couch during my two years in D.C. Being willing to put the time in when the job simply has to get done is rightfully a hallmark of a successful professional. But looking back, I have to admit that my assumption that I would stay late made me much less efficient over the course of the day than I might have been, and certainly less so than some of my colleagues, who managed to get the same amount of work done and go home at a decent hour. If Dick Darman had had a boss who clearly valued prioritization and time management, he might have found reason to turn out the lights and take his jacket home.",
"Long hours are one thing, and realistically, they are often unavoidable. But do they really need to be spent at the office? To be sure, being in the office some of the time is beneficial. In-person meetings can be far more efficient than phone or e-mail tag; trust and collegiality are much more easily built up around the same physical table; and spontaneous conversations often generate good ideas and lasting relationships. Still, armed with e-mail, instant messaging, phones, and videoconferencing technology, we should be able to move to a culture where the office is a base of operations more than the required locus of work.",
"Being able to work from home—in the evening after children are put to bed, or during their sick days or snow days, and at least some of the time on weekends—can be the key, for mothers, to carrying your full load versus letting a team down at crucial moments. State-of-the-art videoconferencing facilities can dramatically reduce the need for long business trips. These technologies are making inroads, and allowing easier integration of work and family life. According to the Women's Business Center, 61 percent of women business owners use technology to \"integrate the responsibilities of work and home\"; 44 percent use technology to allow employees \"to work off-site or to have flexible work schedules.\" Yet our work culture still remains more office-centered than it needs to be, especially in light of technological advances.",
"One way to change that is by changing the \"default rules\" that govern office work—the baseline expectations about when, where, and how work will be done. As behavioral economists well know, these baselines can make an enormous difference in the way people act. It is one thing, for instance, for an organization to allow phone-ins to a meeting on an ad hoc basis, when parenting and work schedules collide—a system that's better than nothing, but likely to engender guilt among those calling in, and possibly resentment among those in the room. It is quite another for that organization to declare that its policy will be to schedule in-person meetings, whenever possible, during the hours of the school day—a system that might normalize call-ins for those (rarer) meetings still held in the late afternoon.",
"One real-world example comes from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a place most people are more likely to associate with distinguished gentlemen in pinstripes than with progressive thinking about work-family balance. Like so many other places, however, the FCO worries about losing talented members of two-career couples around the world, particularly women. So it recently changed its basic policy from a default rule that jobs have to be done on-site to one that assumes that some jobs might be done remotely, and invites workers to make the case for remote work. Kara Owen, a career foreign-service officer who was the FCO's diversity director and will soon become the British deputy ambassador to France, writes that she has now done two remote jobs. Before her current maternity leave, she was working a London job from Dublin to be with her partner, using teleconferencing technology and timing her trips to London to coincide \"with key meetings where I needed to be in the room (or chatting at the pre-meeting coffee) to have an impact, or to do intensive 'network maintenance.'\" In fact, she writes, \"I have found the distance and quiet to be a real advantage in a strategic role, providing I have put in the investment up front to develop very strong personal relationships with the game changers.\" Owen recognizes that not every job can be done this way. But she says that for her part, she has been able to combine family requirements with her career.",
"Changes in default office rules should not advantage parents over other workers; indeed, done right, they can improve relations among co-workers by raising their awareness of each other's circumstances and instilling a sense of fairness. Two years ago, the ACLU Foundation of Massachusetts decided to replace its \"parental leave\" policy with a \"family leave\" policy that provides for as much as 12 weeks of leave not only for new parents, but also for employees who need to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition. According to Director Carol Rose, \"We wanted a policy that took into account the fact that even employees who do not have children have family obligations.\" The policy was shaped by the belief that giving women \"special treatment\" can \"backfire if the broader norms shaping the behavior of all employees do not change.\" When I was the dean of the Wilson School, I managed with the mantra \"Family comes first\"—any family—and found that my employees were both productive and intensely loyal.",
"None of these changes will happen by themselves, and reasons to avoid them will seldom be hard to find. But obstacles and inertia are usually surmountable if leaders are open to changing their assumptions about the workplace. The use of technology in many high-level government jobs, for instance, is complicated by the need to have access to classified information. But in 2009, Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, who shares the parenting of his two young daughters equally with his wife, made getting such access at home an immediate priority so that he could leave the office at a reasonable hour and participate in important meetings via videoconferencing if necessary. I wonder how many women in similar positions would be afraid to ask, lest they be seen as insufficiently committed to their jobs.",
"Revaluing Family Values",
"While employers shouldn't privilege parents over other workers, too often they end up doing the opposite, usually subtly, and usually in ways that make it harder for a primary caregiver to get ahead. Many people in positions of power seem to place a low value on child care in comparison with other outside activities. Consider the following proposition: An employer has two equally talented and productive employees. One trains for and runs marathons when he is not working. The other takes care of two children. What assumptions is the employer likely to make about the marathon runner? That he gets up in the dark every day and logs an hour or two running before even coming into the office, or drives himself to get out there even after a long day. That he is ferociously disciplined and willing to push himself through distraction, exhaustion, and days when nothing seems to go right in the service of a goal far in the distance. That he must manage his time exceptionally well to squeeze all of that in.",
"Be honest: Do you think the employer makes those same assumptions about the parent? Even though she likely rises in the dark hours before she needs to be at work, organizes her children's day, makes breakfast, packs lunch, gets them off to school, figures out shopping and other errands even if she is lucky enough to have a housekeeper—and does much the same work at the end of the day. Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's indefatigable chief of staff, has twins in elementary school; even with a fully engaged husband, she famously gets up at four every morning to check and send e-mails before her kids wake up. Louise Richardson, now the vice chancellor of the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland, combined an assistant professorship in government at Harvard with mothering three young children. She organized her time so ruthlessly that she always keyed in 1:11 or 2:22 or 3:33 on the microwave rather than 1:00, 2:00, or 3:00, because hitting the same number three times took less time.",
"Elizabeth Warren, who is now running for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, has a similar story. When she had two young children and a part-time law practice, she struggled to find enough time to write the papers and articles that would help get her an academic position. In her words:",
"I needed a plan. I figured out that writing time was when Alex was asleep. So the minute I put him down for a nap or he fell asleep in the baby swing, I went to my desk and started working on something—footnotes, reading, outlining, writing … I learned to do everything else with a baby on my hip.",
"The discipline, organization, and sheer endurance it takes to succeed at top levels with young children at home is easily comparable to running 20 to 40 miles a week. But that's rarely how employers see things, not only when making allowances, but when making promotions. Perhaps because people choose to have children? People also choose to run marathons.",
"One final example: I have worked with many Orthodox Jewish men who observed the Sabbath from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday. Jack Lew, the two-time director of the Office of Management and Budget, former deputy secretary of state for management and resources, and now White House chief of staff, is a case in point. Jack's wife lived in New York when he worked in the State Department, so he would leave the office early enough on Friday afternoon to take the shuttle to New York and a taxi to his apartment before sundown. He would not work on Friday after sundown or all day Saturday. Everyone who knew him, including me, admired his commitment to his faith and his ability to carve out the time for it, even with an enormously demanding job.",
"It is hard to imagine, however, that we would have the same response if a mother told us she was blocking out mid-Friday afternoon through the end of the day on Saturday, every week, to spend time with her children. I suspect this would be seen as unprofessional, an imposition of unnecessary costs on co-workers. In fact, of course, one of the great values of the Sabbath—whether Jewish or Christian—is precisely that it carves out a family oasis, with rituals and a mandatory setting-aside of work.",
"Our assumptions are just that: things we believe that are not necessarily so. Yet what we assume has an enormous impact on our perceptions and responses. Fortunately, changing our assumptions is up to us.",
"Redefining the Arc of a Successful Career",
"The American definition of a successful professional is someone who can climb the ladder the furthest in the shortest time, generally peaking between ages 45 and 55. It is a definition well suited to the mid-20th century, an era when people had kids in their 20s, stayed in one job, retired at 67, and were dead, on average, by age 71.",
"It makes far less sense today. Average life expectancy for people in their 20s has increased to 80; men and women in good health can easily work until they are 75. They can expect to have multiple jobs and even multiple careers throughout their working life. Couples marry later, have kids later, and can expect to live on two incomes. They may well retire earlier—the average retirement age has gone down from 67 to 63—but that is commonly \"retirement\" only in the sense of collecting retirement benefits. Many people go on to \"encore\" careers.",
"Assuming the priceless gifts of good health and good fortune, a professional woman can thus expect her working life to stretch some 50 years, from her early or mid-20s to her mid-70s. It is reasonable to assume that she will build her credentials and establish herself, at least in her first career, between 22 and 35; she will have children, if she wants them, sometime between 25 and 45; she'll want maximum flexibility and control over her time in the 10 years that her children are 8 to 18; and she should plan to take positions of maximum authority and demands on her time after her children are out of the house. Women who have children in their late 20s can expect to immerse themselves completely in their careers in their late 40s, with plenty of time still to rise to the top in their late 50s and early 60s. Women who make partner, managing director, or senior vice president; get tenure; or establish a medical practice before having children in their late 30s should be coming back on line for the most demanding jobs at almost exactly the same age.",
"Along the way, women should think about the climb to leadership not in terms of a straight upward slope, but as irregular stair steps, with periodic plateaus (and even dips) when they turn down promotions to remain in a job that works for their family situation; when they leave high-powered jobs and spend a year or two at home on a reduced schedule; or when they step off a conventional professional track to take a consulting position or project-based work for a number of years. I think of these plateaus as \"investment intervals.\" My husband and I took a sabbatical in Shanghai, from August 2007 to May 2008, right in the thick of an election year when many of my friends were advising various candidates on foreign-policy issues. We thought of the move in part as \"putting money in the family bank,\" taking advantage of the opportunity to spend a close year together in a foreign culture. But we were also investing in our children's ability to learn Mandarin and in our own knowledge of Asia.",
"Peaking in your late 50s and early 60s rather than your late 40s and early 50s makes particular sense for women, who live longer than men. And many of the stereotypes about older workers simply do not hold. A 2006 survey of human-resources professionals shows that only 23 percent think older workers are less flexible than younger workers; only 11 percent think older workers require more training than younger workers; and only 7 percent think older workers have less drive than younger workers.",
"Whether women will really have the confidence to stair-step their careers, however, will again depend in part on perceptions. Slowing down the rate of promotions, taking time out periodically, pursuing an alternative path during crucial parenting or parent-care years—all have to become more visible and more noticeably accepted as a pause rather than an opt-out. (In an encouraging sign, Mass Career Customization, a 2007 book by Cathleen Benko and Anne Weisberg arguing that \"today's career is no longer a straight climb up the corporate ladder, but rather a combination of climbs, lateral moves, and planned descents,\" was a Wall Street Journal best seller.)",
"Institutions can also take concrete steps to promote this acceptance. For instance, in 1970, Princeton established a tenure-extension policy that allowed female assistant professors expecting a child to request a one-year extension on their tenure clocks. This policy was later extended to men, and broadened to include adoptions. In the early 2000s, two reports on the status of female faculty discovered that only about 3 percent of assistant professors requested tenure extensions in a given year. And in response to a survey question, women were much more likely than men to think that a tenure extension would be detrimental to an assistant professor's career.",
"So in 2005, under President Shirley Tilghman, Princeton changed the default rule. The administration announced that all assistant professors, female and male, who had a new child would automatically receive a one-year extension on the tenure clock, with no opt-outs allowed. Instead, assistant professors could request early consideration for tenure if they wished. The number of assistant professors who receive a tenure extension has tripled since the change.",
"One of the best ways to move social norms in this direction is to choose and celebrate different role models. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and I are poles apart politically, but he went way up in my estimation when he announced that one reason he decided against running for president in 2012 was the impact his campaign would have had on his children. He reportedly made clear at a fund-raiser in Louisiana that he didn't want to be away from his children for long periods of time; according to a Republican official at the event, he said that \"his son [missed] him after being gone for the three days on the road, and that he needed to get back.\" He may not get my vote if and when he does run for president, but he definitely gets my admiration (providing he doesn't turn around and join the GOP ticket this fall).",
"If we are looking for high-profile female role models, we might begin with Michelle Obama. She started out with the same résumé as her husband, but has repeatedly made career decisions designed to let her do work she cared about and also be the kind of parent she wanted to be. She moved from a high-powered law firm first to Chicago city government and then to the University of Chicago shortly before her daughters were born, a move that let her work only 10 minutes away from home. She has spoken publicly and often about her initial concerns that her husband's entry into politics would be bad for their family life, and about her determination to limit her participation in the presidential election campaign to have more time at home. Even as first lady, she has been adamant that she be able to balance her official duties with family time. We should see her as a full-time career woman, but one who is taking a very visible investment interval. We should celebrate her not only as a wife, mother, and champion of healthy eating, but also as a woman who has had the courage and judgment to invest in her daughters when they need her most. And we should expect a glittering career from her after she leaves the White House and her daughters leave for college.",
"Rediscovering the Pursuit of Happiness",
"One of the most complicated and surprising parts of my journey out of Washington was coming to grips with what I really wanted. I had opportunities to stay on, and I could have tried to work out an arrangement allowing me to spend more time at home. I might have been able to get my family to join me in Washington for a year; I might have been able to get classified technology installed at my house the way Jim Steinberg did; I might have been able to commute only four days a week instead of five. (While this last change would have still left me very little time at home, given the intensity of my job, it might have made the job doable for another year or two.) But I realized that I didn't just need to go home. Deep down, I wanted to go home. I wanted to be able to spend time with my children in the last few years that they are likely to live at home, crucial years for their development into responsible, productive, happy, and caring adults. But also irreplaceable years for me to enjoy the simple pleasures of parenting—baseball games, piano recitals, waffle breakfasts, family trips, and goofy rituals. My older son is doing very well these days, but even when he gives us a hard time, as all teenagers do, being home to shape his choices and help him make good decisions is deeply satisfying.",
"The flip side of my realization is captured in Macko and Rubin's ruminations on the importance of bringing the different parts of their lives together as 30-year-old women:",
"If we didn't start to learn how to integrate our personal, social, and professional lives, we were about five years away from morphing into the angry woman on the other side of a mahogany desk who questions her staff's work ethic after standard 12-hour workdays, before heading home to eat moo shoo pork in her lonely apartment.",
"Women have contributed to the fetish of the one-dimensional life, albeit by necessity. The pioneer generation of feminists walled off their personal lives from their professional personas to ensure that they could never be discriminated against for a lack of commitment to their work. When I was a law student in the 1980s, many women who were then climbing the legal hierarchy in New York firms told me that they never admitted to taking time out for a child's doctor appointment or school performance, but instead invented a much more neutral excuse.",
"Today, however, women in power can and should change that environment, although change is not easy. When I became dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, in 2002, I decided that one of the advantages of being a woman in power was that I could help change the norms by deliberately talking about my children and my desire to have a balanced life. Thus, I would end faculty meetings at 6 p.m. by saying that I had to go home for dinner; I would also make clear to all student organizations that I would not come to dinner with them, because I needed to be home from six to eight, but that I would often be willing to come back after eight for a meeting. I also once told the Dean's Advisory Committee that the associate dean would chair the next session so I could go to a parent-teacher conference.",
"After a few months of this, several female assistant professors showed up in my office quite agitated. \"You have to stop talking about your kids,\" one said. \"You are not showing the gravitas that people expect from a dean, which is particularly damaging precisely because you are the first woman dean of the school.\" I told them that I was doing it deliberately and continued my practice, but it is interesting that gravitas and parenthood don't seem to go together.",
"Ten years later, whenever I am introduced at a lecture or other speaking engagement, I insist that the person introducing me mention that I have two sons. It seems odd to me to list degrees, awards, positions, and interests and not include the dimension of my life that is most important to me—and takes an enormous amount of my time. As Secretary Clinton once said in a television interview in Beijing when the interviewer asked her about Chelsea's upcoming wedding: \"That's my real life.\" But I notice that my male introducers are typically uncomfortable when I make the request. They frequently say things like \"And she particularly wanted me to mention that she has two sons\"—thereby drawing attention to the unusual nature of my request, when my entire purpose is to make family references routine and normal in professional life.",
"This does not mean that you should insist that your colleagues spend time cooing over pictures of your baby or listening to the prodigious accomplishments of your kindergartner. It does mean that if you are late coming in one week, because it is your turn to drive the kids to school, that you be honest about what you are doing. Indeed, Sheryl Sandberg recently acknowledged not only that she leaves work at 5:30 to have dinner with her family, but also that for many years she did not dare make this admission, even though she would of course make up the work time later in the evening. Her willingness to speak out now is a strong step in the right direction.",
"Seeking out a more balanced life is not a women's issue; balance would be better for us all. Bronnie Ware, an Australian blogger who worked for years in palliative care and is the author of the 2011 book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, writes that the regret she heard most often was \"I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.\" The second-most-common regret was \"I wish I didn't work so hard.\" She writes: \"This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's youth and their partner's companionship.\"",
"Juliette Kayyem, who several years ago left the Department of Homeland Security soon after her husband, David Barron, left a high position in the Justice Department, says their joint decision to leave Washington and return to Boston sprang from their desire to work on the \"happiness project,\" meaning quality time with their three children. (She borrowed the term from her friend Gretchen Rubin, who wrote a best-selling book and now runs a blog with that name.)",
"It's time to embrace a national happiness project. As a daughter of Charlottesville, Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson and the university he founded, I grew up with the Declaration of Independence in my blood. Last I checked, he did not declare American independence in the name of life, liberty, and professional success. Let us rediscover the pursuit of happiness, and let us start at home.",
"Innovation Nation",
"As I write this, I can hear the reaction of some readers to many of the proposals in this essay: It's all fine and well for a tenured professor to write about flexible working hours, investment intervals, and family-comes-first management. But what about the real world? Most American women cannot demand these things, particularly in a bad economy, and their employers have little incentive to grant them voluntarily. Indeed, the most frequent reaction I get in putting forth these ideas is that when the choice is whether to hire a man who will work whenever and wherever needed, or a woman who needs more flexibility, choosing the man will add more value to the company.",
"In fact, while many of these issues are hard to quantify and measure precisely, the statistics seem to tell a different story. A seminal study of 527 U.S. companies, published in the Academy of Management Journal in 2000, suggests that \"organizations with more extensive work-family policies have higher perceived firm-level performance\" among their industry peers. These findings accorded with a 2003 study conducted by Michelle Arthur at the University of New Mexico. Examining 130 announcements of family-friendly policies in The Wall Street Journal, Arthur found that the announcements alone significantly improved share prices. In 2011, a study on flexibility in the workplace by Ellen Galinsky, Kelly Sakai, and Tyler Wigton of the Families and Work Institute showed that increased flexibility correlates positively with job engagement, job satisfaction, employee retention, and employee health.",
"This is only a small sampling from a large and growing literature trying to pin down the relationship between family-friendly policies and economic performance. Other scholars have concluded that good family policies attract better talent, which in turn raises productivity, but that the policies themselves have no impact on productivity. Still others argue that results attributed to these policies are actually a function of good management overall. What is evident, however, is that many firms that recruit and train well-educated professional women are aware that when a woman leaves because of bad work-family balance, they are losing the money and time they invested in her.",
"Even the legal industry, built around the billable hour, is taking notice. Deborah Epstein Henry, a former big-firm litigator, is now the president of Flex-Time Lawyers, a national consulting firm focused partly on strategies for the retention of female attorneys. In her book Law and Reorder, published by the American Bar Association in 2010, she describes a legal profession \"where the billable hour no longer works\"; where attorneys, judges, recruiters, and academics all agree that this system of compensation has perverted the industry, leading to brutal work hours, massive inefficiency, and highly inflated costs. The answer—already being deployed in different corners of the industry—is a combination of alternative fee structures, virtual firms, women-owned firms, and the outsourcing of discrete legal jobs to other jurisdictions. Women, and Generation X and Y lawyers more generally, are pushing for these changes on the supply side; clients determined to reduce legal fees and increase flexible service are pulling on the demand side. Slowly, change is happening.",
"At the core of all this is self-interest. Losing smart and motivated women not only diminishes a company's talent pool; it also reduces the return on its investment in training and mentoring. In trying to address these issues, some firms are finding out that women's ways of working may just be better ways of working, for employees and clients alike.",
"Experts on creativity and innovation emphasize the value of encouraging nonlinear thinking and cultivating randomness by taking long walks or looking at your environment from unusual angles. In their new book, A New Culture of Learning: Cultivating the Imagination for a World of Constant Change, the innovation gurus John Seely Brown and Douglas Thomas write, \"We believe that connecting play and imagination may be the single most important step in unleashing the new culture of learning.\"",
"Space for play and imagination is exactly what emerges when rigid work schedules and hierarchies loosen up. Skeptics should consider the \"California effect.\" California is the cradle of American innovation—in technology, entertainment, sports, food, and lifestyles. It is also a place where people take leisure as seriously as they take work; where companies like Google deliberately encourage play, with Ping-Pong tables, light sabers, and policies that require employees to spend one day a week working on whatever they wish. Charles Baudelaire wrote: \"Genius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will.\" Google apparently has taken note.",
"No parent would mistake child care for childhood. Still, seeing the world anew through a child's eyes can be a powerful source of stimulation. When the Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling wrote The Strategy of Conflict, a classic text applying game theory to conflicts among nations, he frequently drew on child-rearing for examples of when deterrence might succeed or fail. \"It may be easier to articulate the peculiar difficulty of constraining [a ruler] by the use of threats,\" he wrote, \"when one is fresh from a vain attempt at using threats to keep a small child from hurting a dog or a small dog from hurting a child.\"",
"The books I've read with my children, the silly movies I've watched, the games I've played, questions I've answered, and people I've met while parenting have broadened my world. Another axiom of the literature on innovation is that the more often people with different perspectives come together, the more likely creative ideas are to emerge. Giving workers the ability to integrate their non-work lives with their work—whether they spend that time mothering or marathoning—will open the door to a much wider range of influences and ideas.",
"Enlisting Men",
"Perhaps the most encouraging news of all for achieving the sorts of changes that I have proposed is that men are joining the cause. In commenting on a draft of this article, Martha Minow, the dean of the Harvard Law School, wrote me that one change she has observed during 30 years of teaching law at Harvard is that today many young men are asking questions about how they can manage a work-life balance. And more systematic research on Generation Y confirms that many more men than in the past are asking questions about how they are going to integrate active parenthood with their professional lives.",
"Abstract aspirations are easier than concrete trade-offs, of course. These young men have not yet faced the question of whether they are prepared to give up that more prestigious clerkship or fellowship, decline a promotion, or delay their professional goals to spend more time with their children and to support their partner's career.",
"Yet once work practices and work culture begin to evolve, those changes are likely to carry their own momentum. Kara Owen, the British foreign-service officer who worked a London job from Dublin, wrote me in an e-mail:",
"I think the culture on flexible working started to change the minute the Board of Management (who were all men at the time) started to work flexibly—quite a few of them started working one day a week from home.",
"Men have, of course, become much more involved parents over the past couple of decades, and that, too, suggests broad support for big changes in the way we balance work and family. It is noteworthy that both James Steinberg, deputy secretary of state, and William Lynn, deputy secretary of defense, stepped down two years into the Obama administration so that they could spend more time with their children (for real).",
"Going forward, women would do well to frame work-family balance in terms of the broader social and economic issues that affect both women and men. After all, we have a new generation of young men who have been raised by full-time working mothers. Let us presume, as I do with my sons, that they will understand \"supporting their families\" to mean more than earning money.",
"I HAVE BEEN BLESSED to work with and be mentored by some extraordinary women. Watching Hillary Clinton in action makes me incredibly proud—of her intelligence, expertise, professionalism, charisma, and command of any audience. I get a similar rush when I see a front-page picture of Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, deep in conversation about some of the most important issues on the world stage; or of Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, standing up forcefully for the Syrian people in the Security Council.",
"These women are extraordinary role models. If I had a daughter, I would encourage her to look to them, and I want a world in which they are extraordinary but not unusual. Yet I also want a world in which, in Lisa Jackson's words, \"to be a strong woman, you don't have to give up on the things that define you as a woman.\" That means respecting, enabling, and indeed celebrating the full range of women's choices. \"Empowering yourself,\" Jackson said in her speech at Princeton, \"doesn't have to mean rejecting motherhood, or eliminating the nurturing or feminine aspects of who you are.\"",
"I gave a speech at Vassar last November and arrived in time to wander the campus on a lovely fall afternoon. It is a place infused with a spirit of community and generosity, filled with benches, walkways, public art, and quiet places donated by alumnae seeking to encourage contemplation and connection. Turning the pages of the alumni magazine (Vassar is now coed), I was struck by the entries of older alumnae, who greeted their classmates with Salve (Latin for \"hello\") and wrote witty remembrances sprinkled with literary allusions. Theirs was a world in which women wore their learning lightly; their news is mostly of their children's accomplishments. Many of us look back on that earlier era as a time when it was fine to joke that women went to college to get an \"M.R.S.\" And many women of my generation abandoned the Seven Sisters as soon as the formerly all-male Ivy League universities became coed. I would never return to the world of segregated sexes and rampant discrimination. But now is the time to revisit the assumption that women must rush to adapt to the \"man's world\" that our mothers and mentors warned us about.",
"I continually push the young women in my classes to speak more. They must gain the confidence to value their own insights and questions, and to present them readily. My husband agrees, but he actually tries to get the young men in his classes to act more like the women—to speak less and listen more. If women are ever to achieve real equality as leaders, then we have to stop accepting male behavior and male choices as the default and the ideal. We must insist on changing social policies and bending career tracks to accommodate our choices, too. We have the power to do it if we decide to, and we have many men standing beside us.",
"We'll create a better society in the process, for all women. We may need to put a woman in the White House before we are able to change the conditions of the women working at Walmart. But when we do, we will stop talking about whether women can have it all. We will properly focus on how we can help all Americans have healthy, happy, productive lives, valuing the people they love as much as the success they seek.",

			"contents": [
"The other week I watched 70 hours of TED talks; short, 18-minute talks given by inspirational leaders in the fields of Technology,Entertainment, and Design (TED). I watched 296 talks in total, and I recently went through the list of what I watched, weeded out the crappy and boring talks, and created a list of the 100 best things I learned !",
"This article isn't entirely about productivity, but I guarantee you'll learn a thing or two. Here are 100 incredible things I learned watching 70 hours of TED talks last week!",
"Productivity",
"1. Studies have shown that what motivates a person the most (in non-factory-type work) is how much autonomy, mastery, and purpose they have, not how much money they make.",
"2. Playing video games can actually make you more productive because video games give you more physical, mental, emotional, and social resilience.",
"3. A lot of people aspire to be productive so they can become happier, but happiness has been shown to lead to productivity, not the other way around.",
"4. You don't have as much attention to give to the world around you as you think. You can't recall memories while processing new data, you can only process so much information at once, and your attention is easily manipulated (like by magicians).",
"5. Innovative thinking is often a slow and gradual process, not a moment of instant, lightbulb-like inspiration.",
"6. If you want people to remember you, sweat the small stuff. Most companies (and people) do the big stuff right, so sweating the small stuff (like getting the user interfaces on your products right) can really set you apart.",
"7. You have three brain systems for love: lust, romantic love, and attachment. To develop more intimate relationships with your significant other, it's important to invest in all three.",
"8. When you create an environment for your employees that makes them truly happy(instead of just rich), more profits may follow.",
"9. Your office is actually a pretty crappy environment to get work done. In fact, when Jason Fried asked folks where their favorite place to get work done was, almost no one said \"in the office\".",
"10. Taking time off can make you a lot more productive, because time away from your work lets you explore, reflect, and come up with better ideas.",
"11. The greatest leaders and companies constantly reflect on why they do what they do, instead of simply doing it.",

			"title": "18 Life Lessons Learned From Traveling The World",
			"headline": "I never thought I would still be nomadic.",
			"contents": [
"I never thought I would still be nomadic. My original round-the-world trip was only supposed to last one year before I went back home, found a \"real\" job, settled down, and by now, be married, have a house, 2.5 children, and complain about my retirement fund to my friends.",
"Yet life took a decidedly different turn and here I am, seven years later, writing this from an overnight train to Copenhagen with the same desire to explore the world and no sign of stopping soon.",
"After so many years on the road, there are a few life lessons I've learned from travel that I never would have learned otherwise and I wanted to share with you today.",
"1. It's not that hard.",
"Every day, people get up, go out the door to travel the world, and survive and thrive. Kids as young as 18 make their way around the world without any problems. All that worrying and fear I had before my trip was for naught – this traveling thing is a lot easier than people make it out to be. You're not the first person to do it and there is a well-worn trail that makes it easy for first times to find their way. If an 18 year can do it, so can you.",
"2. You learn a lot of life skills.",
"People who travel are better adjusted and less socially anxious people and traveling around the world has taught me to how to be more social, be adept and more flexible, and, most importantly, understand non-verbal communication a lot better. It has made me more independent, more open, and, overall, just a better person. There's no reason to be scared that you might not have \"it\" in you. You'd be surprised how often you'll surprise yourself.",
"3. You are never alone.",
"It may seem scary just throwing yourself out there and talking to strangers, but we are all strangers in a strange land. At the end of the day, everyone is very friendly. It took me a while to get used to just saying \"hello\" to strangers, but now it seems like second nature. Everyone is just like you – they are alone in a strange place and are looking for others to be with. People travel to meet other people and that means you. Don't be afraid to approach other travelers and locals. You'll find that when you travel alone, you'll never really be alone.",
"4. You meet some of your closest friends traveling.",
"Whether it was in a restaurant in Vietnam, on a boat in Thailand, or walking into a hostel in Spain, when I least expected (or wanted) to meet people was when I met the best and developed the longest lasting relationships. And even though you may not see them for years, you still end up at their wedding, Christmas dinner, or family celebration. Distance and time cannot break the bond you formed.",
"5. Relationships come and go on the road.",
"I've met lots of people on the road, including members of the opposite sex I've found attractive. But the nature of travel doesn't always lend itself to long-term romantic relationships. It's hard to make something last when everyone moves in different directions and holidays end. If you get too attached too often, you'll have nothing but heartache as people come and go. But I've realized you need to simply enjoy your time together and live in the moment. Dwelling on the future will only keep you from making that leap.",
"6. But chase the ones you like.",
"Yet once in a while, you'll find someone you really connect with. Meaningful romance on the road does happen. And when you have nowhere to be and no place to go other than where you want, sometimes there is no reason not to follow. Don't force yourself to say another good-bye if you don't have to. Pursue it even if the distance seems too vast and the circumstances not right, because you never know where it could lead or how long it might last because, once in a while you meet the one and when you do, you should do everything you can to stay with them.",
"7. It's good to try new things.",
"I used to be a very rigid person, but traveling has helped me loosen up and expand my worldview. I've pushed myself to the limit, eaten new food, taken cooking classes, learned magic tricks, new languages, tried to conquer my fear of heights, and challenged my established views. Travel is all about breaking out of your comfort zone and enjoying all the world has to offer.",
"8. Be adventurous.",
"Doing the canyon swing was tough. So was jumping off the boat in the Galapagos. As was eating the maggots in Thailand and caterpillars in Africa. Then I got my butt kicked in Thai boxing. And, while I won't do most of those ever again, I don't regret trying new things. Scare yourself once in a while. It makes life less dull.",
"9. There is no such thing as a mistake.",
"No matter what happens on the road, it's never a mistake. As was once said, \"your choices are half chance, and so are everybody else's.\" When you go with the flow and let the road just unfold ahead of you, there's no reason to have regrets or think you made a mistake. You make the best decisions you can and, in the end, the journey is the adventure.",
"10. Don't be cheap.",
"When you travel on a budget and need to make your money last, it's easy to be cheap. But why live like a pauper at home while you save so you can skip the food in Italy, the wine in France, or a sushi meal in Japan? While it is good to be frugal, it's also important to splurge and not miss out on doing once-in-a-lifetime things. Who knows when you will get another chance to dive in Fiji?! Take every opportunity.",
"11. That being said, don't be wasteful.",
"But remember you aren't made of money, so don't always feel like you need to party with your new friends every night or do every activity in a new place. Sometimes it's OK just to sit around and relax or cook your own meal. Be frugal, but not cheap.",
"12. Drop the guidebook.",
"Don't be so glued to a book. You can travel fine without it, especially with so many good alternatives on the Internet these days. You'll buy it and hardly use it anyway. Just ask people for tips and information. That will be your best source of information, especially for those off-the-beaten track destinations and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that no one's ever heard of but serve the best food you can imagine.",
"13. It's never too late to change.",
"Even if you aren't the traveler or person you want to be in your head, it's never too late to change. Travel is all about change. The more you say \"tomorrow,\" the less likely it is that tomorrow will ever come. Traveling has shown me aspects of my personality I wish I didn't have and also shown me I'm really lazy. I've always lived by the phrase \"Carpe Diem\" but sometimes I don't really do it. It's never too late though and realizing that has made being more pro-active a lot easier.",
"14. Relax.",
"Life is amazing. There's no reason to worry. The universe unfolds as it should. Relax and just go with it. You can't change the future – it hasn't happened yet. Just make the best decisions you can today and enjoy the moment. Don't get caught up trying to see all the \"must sees.\" There's nothing wrong with spending a day playing games, reading a book, or lounging by the pool.",
"15. Learn more languages (seriously).",
"There're some great benefits to not knowing the local language – like miming out \"chicken\" to let the lady know you want eggs for breakfast – but learning languages is very helpful when you travel, and works out great when you meet other travelers. There's also nothing like surprising people by speaking their language. Moreover, knowing basic phrases will endear you to locals who will appreciate the fact you went the extra mile. You'll find people will be much more helpful, even if you struggle to say hello.",
"16. Wear more sunscreen.",
"Seriously. Science has proven it helps, and with all that beach time you do when you travel, you could always use a little more. Being tan is great. Having skin cancer is not. SPF up.",
"17. People are good.",
"All over the world, I have encountered amazing people who have not only changed my life but have gone out of their way to help me. It's taught me that the old saying is true – you can always depend on the kindness of strangers. My friend Greg taught me long ago not to be guarded against strangers. That experience when I first started traveling changed everything and when you travel with an open heart, unexpected goodness will happen. 99.9999% of the people in the world aren't murders, rapists, or thieves. There's no reason to assume someone is one. Sometimes people are just trying to be friendly.",
"18. There's no such thing as must-see.",
"This is your trip. No one else's. Everyone's journey is their own. Do what you want, when you want, and for how long you want. Don't let anyone tell you aren't a real traveler for skipping the Louvre, avoiding some little town in Peru, or deciding to party in Thailand. This your journey. You owe no one an explanation.",
"I've learned more about the world and myself in the last seven years of travel than I had in the previous 25 years of my life. No matter what happens in the future, I know that travel has taught me life lessons I never would have learned had I stayed in my cubicle job.",
"Find a way to travel as often has you can to all the destinations you dream about.  They will change your life."

			"title": "Architecture and the Lost Art of Drawing",

			"contents": [
"IT has become fashionable in many architectural circles to declare the death of drawing. What has happened to our profession, and our art, to cause the supposed end of our most powerful means of conceptualizing and representing architecture?",
"The computer, of course. With its tremendous ability to organize and present data, the computer is transforming every aspect of how architects work, from sketching their first impressions of an idea to creating complex construction documents for contractors. For centuries, the noun \"digit\" (from the Latin \"digitus\") has been defined as \"finger,\" but now its adjectival form, \"digital,\" relates to data. Are our hands becoming obsolete as creative tools? Are they being replaced by machines? And where does that leave the architectural creative process?",
"Today architects typically use computer-aided design software with names like AutoCAD and Revit, a tool for \"building information modeling.\" Buildings are no longer just designed visually and spatially; they are \"computed\" via interconnected databases.",
"I've been practicing architecture since 1964, and my office is not immune. Like most architects, we routinely use these and other software programs, especially for construction documents, but also for developing designs and making presentations. There's nothing inherently problematic about that, as long as it's not just that.",
"Architecture cannot divorce itself from drawing, no matter how impressive the technology gets. Drawings are not just end products: they are part of the thought process of architectural design. Drawings express the interaction of our minds, eyes and hands. This last statement is absolutely crucial to the difference between those who draw to conceptualize architecture and those who use the computer.",
"Of course, in some sense drawing can't be dead: there is a vast market for the original work of respected architects. I have had several one-man shows in galleries and museums in New York and elsewhere, and my drawings can be found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Cooper-Hewitt.",
"But can the value of drawings be simply that of a collector's artifact or a pretty picture? No. I have a real purpose in making each drawing, either to remember something or to study something. Each one is part of a process and not an end in itself. I'm personally fascinated not just by what architects choose to draw but also by what they choose not to draw.",
"For decades I have argued that architectural drawing can be divided into three types, which I call the \"referential sketch,\" the \"preparatory study\" and the \"definitive drawing.\" The definitive drawing, the final and most developed of the three, is almost universally produced on the computer nowadays, and that is appropriate. But what about the other two? What is their value in the creative process? What can they teach us?",
"The referential sketch serves as a visual diary, a record of an architect's discovery. It can be as simple as a shorthand notation of a design concept or can describe details of a larger composition. It might not even be a drawing that relates to a building or any time in history. It's not likely to represent \"reality,\" but rather to capture an idea.",
"These sketches are thus inherently fragmentary and selective. When I draw something, I remember it. The drawing is a reminder of the idea that caused me to record it in the first place. That visceral connection, that thought process, cannot be replicated by a computer.",
"The second type of drawing, the preparatory study, is typically part of a progression of drawings that elaborate a design. Like the referential sketch, it may not reflect a linear process. (I find computer-aided design much more linear.) I personally like to draw on translucent yellow tracing paper, which allows me to layer one drawing on top of another, building on what I've drawn before and, again, creating a personal, emotional connection with the work.",
"With both of these types of drawings, there is a certain joy in their creation, which comes from the interaction between the mind and the hand. Our physical and mental interactions with drawings are formative acts. In a handmade drawing, whether on an electronic tablet or on paper, there are intonations, traces of intentions and speculation. This is not unlike the way a musician might intone a note or how a riff in jazz would be understood subliminally and put a smile on your face.",
"I find this quite different from today's \"parametric design,\" which allows the computer to generate form from a set of instructions, sometimes resulting in so-called blob architecture. The designs are complex and interesting in their own way, but they lack the emotional content of a design derived from hand.",
"Years ago I was sitting in a rather boring faculty meeting at Princeton. To pass the time, I pulled out my pad to start drawing a plan, probably of some building I was designing. An equally bored colleague was watching me, amused. I came to a point of indecision and passed the pad to him. He added a few lines and passed it back.",
"The game was on. Back and forth we went, drawing five lines each, then four and so on.",
"While we didn't speak, we were engaged in a dialogue over this plan and we understood each other perfectly. I suppose that you could have a debate like that with words, but it would have been entirely different. Our game was not about winners or losers, but about a shared language. We had a genuine love for making this drawing. There was an insistence, by the act of drawing, that the composition would stay open, that the speculation would stay \"wet\" in the sense of a painting. Our plan was without scale and we could as easily have been drawing a domestic building as a portion of a city. It was the act of drawing that allowed us to speculate.",
"As I work with my computer-savvy students and staff today, I notice that something is lost when they draw only on the computer. It is analogous to hearing the words of a novel read aloud, when reading them on paper allows us to daydream a little, to make associations beyond the literal sentences on the page. Similarly, drawing by hand stimulates the imagination and allows us to speculate about ideas, a good sign that we're truly alive.",
"Michael Graves is an architect and an emeritus professor at Princeton."

			"title": "JAMES MAA'S PRODUCTIVITY HACKING GUIDE",
			"headline": "So finals week is coming up, and everyone is looking for ways to be more productive in this time crunch. So I thought I could help people figure out how to make their lives more efficient and productive.",
			"contents": [
"Intro",
"So finals week is coming up, and everyone is looking for ways to be more productive in this time crunch. So I thought I could help people figure out how to make their lives more efficient and productive. People have seen my productivity hacks and they have told me I'm crazy, OCD, a workaholic, super asian, etc. I just take them as a compliment and I become flattered because I never thought myself as quite that.",
"You see, I used to be a aimless and lazy chump. I got by day-by-day using my high school planner, writing due dates and just doing things the night before. I'm not quite sure how I spent my time or where it had gone, but it's gone. I got by the bare-minimums. \"Just do enough\" was probably my life model.",
"I'm not quite sure what prompted me to change but I can tell you, it didn't happen all at in an instance. I couldn't trace the genesis of my change to any major family trauma or inspirational mentor. It started out with small things. I started out with using post it notes to write to-do lists every day. Then I thought it was pretty cool. So then I added a calendar for appointments and special events. Then I started trying out more and more productivity hacks and reading more about productivity and now I've built up a whole repertoire of tools and skills to help me stay motivated, productive, and sane.",
"My friends want to know how I do what I do. They ask me how much time I spend doing these productive things. I spend about 3 to 5 hours a week planning and preparing, but it has lead me to much higher returns. They want to know what keeps me motivated, what keeps me sane. They want to see how I tick, and I'd be happy to share.",
"The Productivity Hacking Guide is broken down into three major components or objectives: staying motivated, being efficient, and staying sane, all of which are equally important to the end goals of being productive. This guide isn't meant for just dead week and finals week, this guide could be applicable all across life. Keep up these good habits, and you'll be off to your own great things as well. You don't have to follow this guide all the way through. Take it step by step if you find it too much. Feel free to ignore some portions if you believe you have those under control (although there's always room for improvements). Feedback is also greatly appreciate so send me a line or drop a tip! :)",
"Objectives",
"Motivation: Motivation is important. How will you do great things if you can't motivate yourself to do those things? Goals will help keep you motivated. Study after study shows that people who regularly set goals do significantly better than people who don't. And other studies show that the biggest factor in determining a person's success is by their determination.",
"Efficiency: You only 168 hours a week, and you're life's already a quarter way over. How are you going to spend that time? How can you maximize your time and leverage these 168 hours so that you live the best life you possibly can? Planning out your time and recording what you have done will help you structure your time and help you identify areas where you can improve on.",
"Sanity: You don't want to burn out, that's the last thing you want to do before finals week. But if you're spending your waking hours studying your Chemistry book or doing Linear Algebra problem sets, then you might be burning out your sanity candle way earlier than you intended. How do you stay sane after being so god damn efficient?",
"Great! Let's start!",
"Goals",
"Always have big goals. Take a piece of paper out, write down anywhere from 5-10 overreaching goals in your life. If you need inspiration, you can check out mine. Goals are important because they are the lifeline of your motivation. If you want to keep yourself motivated by the end of the week, you should have these goals and write them down. They will motivate you. It could be anything, but it has to be genuine and part of you. It could be \"Open a Children's Hospital\" or \"Cure AIDS.\" Point is that is they have to be your goals, not your parents' or your friends' or your girlfriend's (although making them happy could be a goal of yours).",
"Now that you have a bunch of goals written down, open up an excel document and write down all your goals in the columns of the spreadsheet. Oh by the way make sure to save it as \"Powerful Moments.xls\" because that's what you're going to write down in the following columns. You're going to further explore your goals. This part is inspired by a blog entry by MIT admissions officer Ben Jones entitled \"50 Things.\" The whole article's a good read if you ever have time (it's just a list of 50 things that make a meaningful college experience). The purpose of the document is to substantiate your goals with real experiences, kind of like having quoting evidence when you write an essay. That way, every day when you write your goals, you'll have something empowering to think about. For instance, maybe if one of your goals was \"get good grades,\" you can write down \"06/09/12- I got an F on my math final and I realized that if I had worked harder, I would've easily gotten an A.\" It could be emotions of any form, positive, negative, sad, it just has to drive you in some shape or form.",
"Start seeding those experiences. If you find a hard time listing moments for some of these goals, you could just list why you want this as a goal. If that's troubling you, maybe it's time to pick a new one. Maybe getting good grades isn't your top priority, but becoming a doctor is, and getting good grades will help get you there. As you start digging up your chestboxes of memories, feel free to add, delete, or edit any of these goals. The point is to be reflective of who you truly are anyways.",
"If you ever encounter a powerful moment, whether when you fail a test or when someone breaks up with you, write the moment down in this excel sheet. You see, people are emotionally powered machines, and you need keep moments like these that fundamentally change who you are for the better. You're always learning a lesson from your failures. Don't let those failures slip your foresight, or you're bound to repeat them again.",
"Once you have this down, you're all set up! Top goals are done, but those seem so far away! Isn't it a bit saddening knowing the long journey you have to travel to  get to where you want to be? Well that's why we won't write just 1 Post-It note a day, we'll write 2! So it's a new morning day and you just woken up, wtf do you do with your day? Well, that's just what your second Post-It note is for. Looking at your top goals post-it, write down things you have to do for the day. It's your very own to-do list. You have to write one every day to stay focused. It takes 10 minutes a day to plan out what you want to accomplish.",
"Write down all the things you have to do for the day followed by an estimation of how much time it takes. For instance \"Study Math 1A — 1Hr\" or \"Plan Telebears Phase – 2hr.\" Try to put a small upper bound on the time commitment to these tasks so you know that you will be able to complete these tasks before the allotted time. After you listed out all the tasks you have to do, calculate the total commitment of work you have for the day. Stick this Post-it (and your top goals Post it) somewhere visible like your laptop or planner.",
"If you would like more structure, then you are welcomed to write weekly or monthly goals. Sometimes they help you structure your life road map better. I used to do it for fun. I would have \"themed weeks\" where I spent around 10-15 hours a week focusing on a different theme like \"Cooking\" or \"Breakdancing.\" Sometimes it helps to do them because habits can form during those times and in all honesty it really makes life a lot more interesting when you plan variety into it. But they work professionally as well. Right now I write a weekly post it that outlines the amount of work I have to do for the week. If you're expecting Math homework to be due every week, then you should write something like \"Math Hw — 5Hr.\" That way, when I run  a bit dry on things to do for my day, I can look up the overarching weekly goals and put in time in those goals.",
"When you write weekly or monthly goals, you should write SMART goals. SMART goals stand for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely, goals. Follow these guidelines to staying on track when you write daily, weekly, and monthly goals.",
"I would like to spend a paragraph addressing goals and the motivation behind it. Did you know the biggest factor in determining whether a person will be successful is by how determined or hardworking they are? It's true. Yet, most people wait for determination to come to them. As if waiting for some motivational cupid to shoot an arrow that sparks a passion so fiery that they work to their heart's last heartbeat. It's not coming, you have to initiate it. Determination, motivation, and inevitably self control are muscles in your body. You have to work on it, and the more you work on it, the stronger it gets. You break it down so it builds back up. It's certainly been true for me. I always thought myself as lazy, but when I decided to start creating habits of motivation, things began to change for me. I stuck through the demotivational parts where I tried my best to exercise self control and persistence, and I think I can begin seeing its effects on me. Trust me, the more you do this motivational stuff, the more motivated you will be, don't give up! That's what the top goals and powerful moments are for, it's a quick pick-me-up if you're ever feeling down.",

"Planning Your Day (And Life!)",
"If you don't use Google Calendar, start using it now (Or some form of online calendaring)! If you don't know how you spend your time, then you won't know where you're wasting time and where you can gain a couple of extra hours. So here's what you're going to do: make a schedule! Since it's already finals week and we're beginning a new semester soon, I'll just let you guys plan your schedules week by week, but usually for normal weeks I have a recurring event that is basically the skeleton to my week. Here's basically what mine looks like (but with gaps where classes were supposed to be):",
"I shall preemptively guess your thoughts:",
"Wow! It's so filled up!",
"Wow! It's so colorful!",
"James! You're crazy!",
"Yes. Let's talk a little more about this. You're going to make several calendars. I personally have 11 calendars, but you should at the very least have:",
"Normal One (Usually your name) (Green): You keep your productive miscellaneous tasks here. Calendar time is here",
"Sleep (Light Blue)",
"Food, Shower, and Transportation (Bare necessities)(Pink): Hygiene, walking (not a legal form of exercise), getting ready in the morning",
"Break or Screw Around (Yellow): Minimize these or keep them to around 5-10 hours a week.",
"Exercise (Aquamarine?)",
"School (Red) — Anything school related, including homework and studying (or you could make separate calendars)",
"Social (Orange)–Anything that involves developing relationships with other people. Social is actually an important calendar that is not meant to be minimized. I try to keep it around 5-10 hours a week. It keeps you mentally and spiritually healthy. Screwing around with your existing friends don't count because there's usually not much to talk about. This is where \"convenience\" friends come into play. If you're only around certain friends because they're convenient and accessible to you, but you don't particularly enjoy your time with, they are convenience friends. I don't count them in social, I put them in Break.",
"I would have more calendars to keep track of how much time I'm spending on each particular goal. For reference, my other calendars are:",
"Blogging (Gray)",
"Programming (Purple)",
"Startup (Blue)",
"Outside Education (Brown): I'm learning to play guitar and sing here. Audiobooks and outside reading goes here as well",
"Office Hours (Neon Purple; not shown): I keep track of my Teaching Assistant's Office Hours when I need to visit them",
"First things first when it comes to planning your week is NOT to fill it up with all your school work and things to do. You HAVE TO start with sleep, basic necessities, and break (yes, break). Why? If you have read The Now Habit (which I believe everyone should read), then you know that in order to be human, you should plan around your sleep schedule and playtime, because you need to have those or you'll lose steam really quickly. Work hard, play hard. Get an ideal but doable weekly schedule going, with spaces in between to stay flexible.",
"Remember the previous exercise we did on writing daily goals and tasks? It's time to plan those into your calendar. The rule of thumb is that if your task is longer than 30 minutes, you plan it on your schedule, if your task is longer than 15 minutes, you group them together (I like to use the tasks feature in Google Calendar) and set a time for the day to do all your < 15-min tasks. If it's a 5 minute task or less, you do it on the spot. Trust me, you'll feel so much better. You plan your day everyday, the skeleton is just to help structure your day, give it a template.",
"Google calendars has some other neat features as well. You can have your calendar send you reminders as well. Whether it's iPhone reminders, email reminders, or text reminders, you can give get it. You don't have to keep track of everything in your head anymore. That just wastes your brain bandwidth that you could be using for other things. You can also add and organize your tasks on your Google calendar. I sometimes put it there if I can't immediately act on the task, like getting back to someone you promised you would.",
"It order to maximize your productivity, you want to aim for as well distributed color of a calendar as possible. Having a giant chunk of school isn't going to do your productivity or memory any good. Mix in some exercise in the middle, or some time to hang out with your friends. Aim for a time interval on a particular task that slightly pushes you to exercise your willpower, but definitely keep it in a doing time frame. If you find that you can concentrate on a particular task for 30 minutes, try going for 45 minutes next time, or even a hour, before switching tasks. Building concentration, like will power, is a form of exercise that only grows stronger through practice.",
"Why it works",
"Have you ever watched an installation bar when you were a kid? Doesn't the loading bar move slow excruciatingly slowly. And then you begin to play games like pointing to the bar, counting to 10, and seeing how far you've gone? You distract yourself from knowing how far along you are and focus on the moving blue bar rather the 33% sign on the side. Having a calendar system is like that. The calendar works and helps beat procrastination and  stagnation because it reduces brain bandwidth and allows us to focus on the present. Many people's lives are ruled by their pasts or their futures. They live lives full of regret or worry, and are often paralyzed by these fears. If you were to plan ahead in your head, then you would have to consider future worries that are inactionable, and you would have to think about these all the time. That paper deadline will always be in your head because you can't let it out, and if you do let it out, you will forget. We are also frozen by our past regrets, which may render us helpless. By allocating time to plan out your day or week ahead, you can spend 30 mins a day looking ahead so you wouldn't have to worry about what you have to do throughout your day or where you're going with your life, you can stay in the now and focus on the task at hand without cluttering. If you plan well, then the path to completion shouldn't be about staring at the status bar the whole time.",
"Keeping Track of Your Time",
"Do you ever wonder where your time went? In a blink of an eye you're already 18, 19, or 20. What exactly have you done with (about) a quarter of your life? Well, as Monte Cristo once said, \"You can kill me, but at least let me keep my memories.\" (or something like that, that was the essence). Point is that without consciously living out our lives on a daily basis, doing meaningful things, life can seem to flash by. Whether it's because you're playing or working too hard, time seems to slip, so you want to know where it has gone.",
"Methods",
"There are various ways to log your time, and I usually stick to 2 or 3 ways that is pretty effective to keep track of what you do. The first is using Google Calendar. Usually throughout the day, when you have a couple of minutes or so throughout the day, spent a couple of seconds to recall what you have done during the day. I usually keep things in 30 minute intervals, because that's the lowest denominator of time spent on Google Calendar. So in the previous photo of the calendar, I could write down things like \"homework\" or \"sleep\" or \"hang out with friends.\"",
"Naturally, you will probably run into the problem of forgetting what you did or losing track of time. That is not good. You will have to recover it and try to remember. Usually not remembering what you were doing is a bad sign, because you weren't living consciously or were aware of what you were doing. BAAAAAAD, don't let it happen. But we can usually recover or jog your memory as to what happened.",
"One of the easiest way to find out what you were doing is probably your browser history. That's usually where people end up slipping. Maybe they caught a photo of a leaping cat on their newsfeed, which led them to reddit, and they all of a sudden spent 2 hrs browsing through internet sites. Yeah, checking your browser history will give you a definitive log of what you did. Another source of clues is your text messages. Maybe you actually spent the last 30 minutes texting a girl (who has subsequently friend-zoned you).",
"Other times you can jog some memories as to the context of the situation. Those are usually the two ways I tend to remember what has happened if I forget. But if these sources fail, fear not! Just leave it blank. Most people aren't as OCD as I am when it comes to these things.",
"Another way to keep track of time is do download RescueTime (ref link). Yes, get it. What RescueTime does is keep track of your computer time and logs your hours. It could be very enlightening as to how you spend your time on the computer, and there are so many features on RescueTime that make life so much more productive. It's completely customizable and it'll help you realize the depressing amount of time you spend on Facebook.",
"Logging Your Time",
"Start a new excel sheet (I usually like to keep separate excel sheets for each term like 1st semester freshman year, summer, etc), and in the rows start listing out the times you want to track. Usually it entails goals and all your calendar activities. Here's what mine looks like. It could act like a template for you:At the beginning of every week, you go back to your last week's calendar and count up how much time you spent for each of these rows. There are certain rules I follow to ensure that I keep an accurate recount of everything. You can choose to follow these rules or not, or make up your own.",
"Rules",
"Food, Shower, or Transportation plus anything else that's productive would eliminate the FoShoTrans time slot. For instance, if I spent my 30 mins in the shower singing, then I won't count the shower time, but will count the singing time instead. This helps alleviate the amount of time one spends eating, showering, and commuting. Sleeping on the bus would eliminate the transportation time.",
"Productive tasks are rounded down and unproductive tasks are rounded up. 15mins spent on productive tasks means 0 hrs on your calendar, whereas in an unproductive calendar it entails 30 mins.",
"Social calendar is very ambiguous, if you eat with the same people during lunch over and over again, that is not considered a social activity, you're too comfortable around those people and not developing meaningful relationships with them. Eating lunch with new people, going out of your comfort zone to talk to strangers, or hitting on girls count as social. The reasoning is behind my goals #4, #5 (Be social and meet girls). It doesn't count if you're just sitting with the same people, it's quite unproductive actually unless you're developing a more meaningful relationship (like helping a friend with a crisis or talking about your problems)..",
"Anything productive that doesn't fall into any of the categories is your name calendar (i.e. default calendar). This could mean emails, calendar analysis, extra curricular meetings, and preparing for your day.",
"Prep and Prep day are separate. Prep is dressing up, brushing your teeth, washing your face, and getting ready for school. Prep day entails goal writing, day planning, 5-minute tasks, and post-it writing.",
"Unaccounted is any blank spaces you leave on your calendar. Time left is total time in the week subtracted by the total amount of time you log. It could be negative if you multitask or count things twice.",
"Read/OLearn is reading and outside learning. RT-Prod is RescueTime Productive time (you can find this number in your RescueTime account) RT-Dis is RescueTime Distracting. It's the unproductive time of RescueTime. The Top 3 Dis. is the top 3 distractions, just so I can identify the most distracting things I'm doing.",
"I usually write a quick summary as well. At the end of the spreadsheet I like to add a couple of more columns like Total, Average, and Standard Deviation . If you know some basic excel skills, this should be no problem. The standard deviation is actually an important indicator because it tells you how consistent you are at staying on target with your goals.",
"I have a comment section to note things that occur. Usually it's commenting about how I spend my time and how I feel about the future. Definitely look over the statistics to identify places where you can save time. Maybe you spend too much time preparing for your day (I average around 10% of my time on FoShoTrans), or maybe you sleep too much, or hang out with your friends too often. Whatever it is, you have to consider whether it is contributing to your goals or whether it is necessary for your survival. If it's neither of these, it's time to cut them down. Now you have mastered your time. Moving on to how to save time.",
"Time Saving Tricks",
"Online Activities",
"You should start checking out your RescueTime stats after a week now. It probably has some demoralizing statistics for you (or optimistic, who knows). Point is, you know you can do better. How? StayFocusd (Chrome Extension) and Self Control (Mac Apps).",
"StayFocusd gives you a set amount of time for distracting internet time every day. You list all the common distracting websites you browse, and give yourself a limit to how much time you want to spend on the website everyday. Then have it run in the browser. Afterwards, everytime you surf a \"blocked website,\" the countdown clock will slowly wind down. Once you reached 0:00, you are done with distracting sites for the day, and StayFocusd blocks those sites. It'll seriously make you so much more efficient with your Facebook time, you'll be blazing through your notifications to avoid dwelling on someone else's life. No more getting distracted by hot girls from your old high school who posts vacation photos. It forces you to put a priority on the information you're interested — ones involving you or ones involving other people's lives",
"Another setting you should add is the nuclear option. Set your nuclear option to automatically block all your distracting sites from 2AM-8AM (or earlier/later if you prefer). Because nothing happens on Facebook at 2AM, so constantly refreshing and checking your notifications isn't going to do squat for your enjoyment nor your productivity. Also, there is a strong correlation that the sleepier we get, the more easily distracted we get. So if you don't have your work finished, you shouldn't be browsing, and if you do, you should be sleeping.",
"And you should just block certain sites and applications. Give up video games and television. Do they really benefit your life? I found it depressing when I couldn't recite all 150 original pokemons today when I used to live and breathe that television show when I was a kid, spending hours upon hours wasting my childhood engaging in that show. The same goes with video games like Runescape, Neopets, and Maple Story. Sure it relieves stress, but there are so many other ways that could release stress more AND make you a better person AND use less time. Check out the \"How to Keep Your Sanity\" section.",
"Self Control is a similar app that blocks distracting sites, but it acts more like a timer. When you decide to turn on Self Control for a certain amount of time, you physically shut off the distracting sites from the internet for a certain amount of time. You just can't go on them, Self Control just blocked the IP addresses from your computer for a certain amount of time. Now you know there is no stopping it, and you could go back to doing your work. I find this helpful if I can't help but browse Facebook and I'm just wasting my time. Just turn this on and get back to work.",
"Sleep",
"Sleep is my biggest weakness, but it also the most important part of your life. Getting out of bed is the hardest thing to do and being sleepy is one of the most demotivating things you can experience. Because what is better than glorious, glorious sleep? I sleep around 7 hours a day, but I tend to vary a lot in my sleep time. Maybe you can do better with 6 or 5 hours of sleep. I'll tell you what I know and hopefully you can get by with less sleep. This section tends to be very opinionated and on a personal basis. It could work for you, but if it doesn't, forget it. Honestly, sleep should be the last thing you cut out of your schedule, this is almost as a last resort. Having adequate sleep is very important. I almost don't recommend you cutting back on sleep. But if you need that extra boost or would like higher quality sleep, read on!",
"The key to sleeping? Naps. Naps are scientifically proven to leverage more sleep than large chunks of sleep. I think it's true as well. I always take a nap in the afternoon dip in the engineering library. It does wonders for your focus. You're going to want to do homework or study right before you take those naps (then you become really sleepy) and right after, when you become much more focused. Taking more than one nap is encouraged as well. In fact, you should check out this sleep hacking chart. I've never fully transitioned to these schedules, but I know the key is to stay consistent . If you have the self-control (or are coincidentally busy enough), then it will probably work out for you.",
"If I'm on a time crunch, I try not to sleep on my bed. Beds are too comfortable, and you might sleep more than you have to. Couches and desks, on the other hand, are only comfortable enough to sleep until you can survive. I have leveraged much more time and focus from sleeping on couches and desks that it helps me stay awake for longer times in the night. If you plan on sleeping until the morning, but you're only getting like 3-4 hours of sleep, consider sleeping with the lights on. Something about it makes my rest more restful.",
"I'm going to spend a paragraph talking about one of my worst nightmares–food comas. Food comas for me tend to not contribute very well to your sleep time while making you very, very tired. You wake up miserable but not well rested. I always end up getting a food coma from eating food from the dining halls and feel pretty bad afterwards. I think there are some ways to prevent food comas. First off, limit the carbs you eat, especially simple carbs from the dining hall. Carbs make you sleepy. Avoid it by eating more proteins or a salad. You could also not eat as much (you know you don't need another plate of curly fries). Another thing you have to do is to stay hydrated. Always drink water. It's actually a good ideas for any situation to help you stay awake. Your brain needs water to function and sometimes you need water to stay awake. Do you ever get the feeling when you sleep for a long time and you wake up with a headache or feel lightheaded? That's because you're dehydrated, either because you didn't drink enough water or you sleep so long that by now most of your water has left your body. A similar concept goes into eating food. If you don't drink water, the food's going to suck up all the water and you're going to be dehydrated, and therefore sleepy. If you do plan on napping, try to drink as much water as you can before your nap, and the first sign of consciousness you have, even if you're super sleepy, get a sip of water. That's actually how I get out of bed every day. First thing I do when I reach consciousness is drink water, because our body needs it most when we're awake.",
"If you have trouble waking up despite the amount of hours you sleep, it's probably a problem with your self-control. Set up an alarm, and make sure you don't compromise with yourself and sleep another 10 mins. It will only make you feel more tired when you wake up and scientifically it doesn't help you feel more well rested. Just do it. Perhaps plan something you can look forward to. If alarms sound too intrusive, consider getting a vibrating alarm. These alarms not only have the option to blast off your ears, they also have an option to have a vibrating unit placed under your unit to buzz you awake. It's actually pretty relaxing way to wake up, it's calming and gets my blood flowing. It doesn't even wake my roommates up because it's so quiet and only I could feel it. In fact, my roommates have gotten so envious of my alarm system that both of them bought the EXACT same alarm clock model as me. Now we have 3 of the exact same alarm clock in my room =.=",
"Sleep in chunks of 90 minutes. That's usually how long a complete sleep cycle lasts. Of course this varies from person to person, so adjust accordingly. If you want to have a \"gentle\" way of waking up, you should try the Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock for iPhone (Sleep as Android for Android users). It has great reviews and it has worked pretty well for me. It uses your phone's accelerometer to determine how much you move during your sleep and uses that metric to determine what stage you are in your sleep schedule and wakes you up accordingly based on your sleep stage. The only problem with it was that since it requires that you put your phone next to your pillow (i.e. very close to you), I have a tendency to turn it off quickly. But overall, it does pretty good wonders.",
"Other methods of waking up that I've tried that have worked in the past are moaning and/or groaning as loudly as you can, doing the Bruce Almighty wake up routine, shifting to a doggy style position, leaning my head over the bed (so blood flows to my brain), or getting someone to wake you up (Hi Mom!). Good luck with your sleep. Sleep is necessary! Don't pull all nighters. Stay consistent (even on weekends), and follow these tips.",
"Food, Shower, Transportation",
"If you have started logging your hours right now, you will realize that you spend an absurd amount of time just eating, preparing for your day, showering, hygiene, and transportation.

I could go through them pretty quickly as I commute around every day. I tend to read less-than-legally downloaded books because there's a wider selection of subjects. But if you like something, you should definitely consider buying it. There are plenty of legal sites that offer a wide selection of audiobooks. If you don't have audiobooks, download tedtalks or get a TED app from the app store. Or if have the radio, find your NPR station. I like reading fiction books via audiobooks and sparknoting the summary plots afterwards to make sure I'm on the right path. There is also a strong collection of self-help books for your benefit as well. But audiobooks are your friend. Everyone's listening to music all day, every day, you should spend some of that music time into audiobook time. You spend most of your working time listening to music anyways. I spend about 2 hours a day commuting back and forth from my dorm to school and around campus to classes. If I spent all that time listening to audiobooks (which I won't), I'll could read Ender's Game 65 times. A lot of times I listen at 2x speed as well if I feel particularly focused or if the book tends to have a lot of fluffy material. Imagine all the knowledge you could gain if you just spent your typical 1 hour a day listening to something informational on your iPod or MP3 Player.",

"Although I won't take it to that extreme, there are factors that may to taking more time than you originally intend to. Perhaps you're spending more time reading email than you would like, or you're investing in unrewarding relationships,  you'll probably reconsider whether those activities and commitments are worth your time or effort or not.

Never think about an assignment as a task of completion, but rather a task of initiation. This is again re-emphasized in The Now Habit . You should never ask yourself, \"when should I finish this assignment?\" But rather you should always ask yourself \"when can I begin?\" Notice the use of \"can.\" It uses a sense of optimism and sense of commitment. If you don't want to start an assignment, commit yourself to doing it for only 15 minutes. 15 minutes (usually less) is the amount of time is takes to get your brain in the mood of studying or doing homework. Treat every task as a start of a journey, even if you're finishing up a project. The starting mentality gets better with practice, but the concept holds.",
"Never play the victim when it comes to difficult tasks, always take the proactive role. You're only going to make yourself miserable if you go against your free will and saying \"I have to do it.\" Instead, changing your mentality to \"I want to do it\" could completely change how you see your assignments and assignments. Why, after all, are you taking a class if it's not to learn about a particular subject or major? What you're doing should be directly relevant to you and your goals",
"This brings me to another point. You have to convince yourself that you are a hard worker. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. There was a scientific study (back by other institutions) that basically goes like this (further explained by the NYMag Article):",
"A group of children are divided into two experimental groups. Both groups of students are given a moderately difficult but doable task of completing mental challenges. One group of students were then praised for \"being smart\" while the other group was praised for \"being hardworking.\" The researchers then gave the children a choice of another mental task: a task that is the same difficulty as the one they completed or a task that is harder to solve. Researchers found out that the 90% of the children who were praised for their work ethics chose the harder task whereas a majority (probably around 55%) of the children who were praised for their intelligence chose the easier task.",
"Maybe you're blaming your parents for fucking  you up as a child by praising your intelligence and making you lazy (I had a mixture of praise of both). But for fucks sake you're in college now. Your position in life right now is your own doing, take some control over your life and your attitude on life.",
"The problem with modern society is, no one's going to praise you for your hard work. Everyone's going to talk about how smart you are, or how you can ace tests without studying, or can do things without trying. Don't get sucked into this. Sometimes I find praises like these offensive or condescending. I've worked hard for my grades and knowledge, I want to be rewarded for what I've earned, not ascribed as a trait that is supposedly inherent in me. People have complimented me on these attributes. \"James why are you so smart?\" \"James you're such a fast learner!\" \"James you're just godly with CS.\" Yeah, no shit, it's because I spend more time dedicating myself to these activities that I have reached this level. Sometimes I feel like people do that to mess with me, to put me on a pedestal just so they can watch me stumble and fall. The pressure of holding up an image of being naturally smart is hard and frankly completely stupid. Peers who peer pressure you into this image should not be around you at all. Correct them if they are ignorant, but cut them loose if they want to see you fail.",
"Point is you have to praise yourself for your hard work whenever you accomplish something. No one else will do it for you. If someone asks you why you are so smart, you reply that it's because you worked really hard in this class. You want to be perceived as an honest and hard worker. Every time you check a bullet off your to-do list. Congratulate yourself on how hard you've worked to get the pleasure of scratching the task off your Post-It note. Even say self-praises out loud if you can. I've actually taken a fully Anthony Robbins  self improvement course where I had to take walks every day at 8AM for a whole week where the audiotape tells you to chant \"Everyday in every way I'm getting better and better\" or \"I know I can because I can\" or turning an \"energy dial\" at the center of your chest. It's cheesy but it works in mysterious ways.",
"Everything you have that is important to you, you have earned it at one point or another. Whether it's your grades, your girlfriend, your reputation, your body, your friends, it's all done through hard work. Spend some time to understand and embrace that concept. When people hand you things on a silver platter, it's no accomplishment of yours. Work hard.",
"Study Habits",
"Now that you have a good mentality to start with, here's how you keep the flame going. Use the pomodoro technique (watch the video!). The idea is that you set aside 25 minutes of uninterrupted work. That means during these 25 mins you don't take text messages, phone calls. You don't go on Facebook. Don't even think about eating or going on other websites. Even if someone comes up to you and talk, spend a quick 10 seconds explaining that you're busy right now and you'll talk to them when you're available. Just focus. The point of this time-boxing technique is that since you are dedicating the time to do something, you might as well be as productive as you can within this time. Have you ever had those classes where teachers give 10 minutes of class time in the end of the class to start on your homework and everyone clamors to get their homework finished by then? The idea's the same. You're stuck in class for an hour anyways, with no distractions, you might as well make the best out of it.",
"Now when your 25 minutes is done, you get a 5 minute break to do whatever you want. Check your texts, calls, FB notifs. Talk to someone. I suggest stretch and minor exercise breaks. After the break is done, you go back to your work and start a new pomodoro.",
"I personally do pomodoro chunks of 55 mins followed by 5 mins, but 25 min is probably more efficient for beginners. It's difficult to do at first, but you'll get the hang of it. I personally use Time Out to track my pomodoro times because it's automatic (it goes on and off automatically) and it actually blocks your computer screen so it forces you to stand up and stretch, get water, or go to the bathroom while you wait.",
"Also, to help me focus, I open up two windows. One of them is my personal stuff (I usually open my gmail, calendar, rainymood.com, and 8tracks.com, hypem.com, or songza.com), and one of the other one is purely academics. So if I'm working on my computer science homework, I would keep all relevant CS pages open on my second window and hide my first one. The idea behind this is that you keep your personal and academic tabs separate so you don't see flashing tabs at you or tempting you like a button waiting to be pushed.",
"Also a key point is to never check your email or facebook the first thing you do. It's going to set a bad first step forward to your study session and you'll mostly likely get hooked or distracted by one thing or another.",
"How to Keep Your Sanity",
"People burn out, it's a fact. People crumble under the stress. One-too-many all-nighters pulled could change a goody-two-shoes into a hardcore, biker-shoes heroin-addict. You think this whole sanity thing is like a disease stricken upon unsuspecting over achievers, but in reality it's completely preventable.",
"How do you stay focused in all this stress and work? You need to find some ways. I'll show you some of mine.",
"Pick a Hobby (or Two or More)",
"As I iterated before, you HAVE TO plan fun times, break times to help you destress or unwind. This doesn't have to mean mind-numbing television or drugs and alcohol (I actually highly discourage it). I recommend both a sport and a creative outlet.",
"Exercise is important to keep everyone happy. Even if you aren't getting enough sleep, you should still exercise a bit. Exercising produces happy hormones that makes you happy and it's a great change of pace from your typical school work. You'll meet a more diverse group of people than your classes. You'll get the stress out. Sometimes I exercise with all my problems on my mind. I physically exert my frustrations on whatever's on hand, whether it's lifting weights or running hard for the frisbee so that by the time I'm dead tired, the problems don't seem so problemsome anymore, and I achieve a sense of tranquility that helps me tackle my other challenges when I'm done. It's really rewarding. Go to the gym, join an intramural or club team, or just throw a frisbee with your roommate. It's going to make a significant difference, and it'll help you keep off those freshman 15. Spend at least 5 hours a week exercising (Walking around campus doesn't count).",
"Pick a creative outlet. Whether it's guitar, singing, drawing, writing, photoshopping, cooking, corn-maze-designing, find something that is outside your major that you enjoy doing. It doesn't have to be something you're good at, but you should enjoy doing it. For example, I love singing, but I'm just so horrendously horrible at it. So what I do is I make sure I stay on campus until late at night until the libraries close (around 1 or 2AM), then when I walk home, there won't be anybody around me to hear me so I could sing to my heart's content. It's so relaxing when you reward yourself with these small things for your hard work.  Try picking up an instrument or a hobby. You don't have to stick with one. Check out this reddit post out for ideas and these online resources for ideas. If you're like me, you're going to want to learn everything because everything is so exciting.",
"Spend Time Alone",
"You're going to have to spend some time out of your hectic day to reflect on your life. I tend to do this on my walks home at night. Sometimes all it takes is a deep breath of solace and enjoy the peaceful environment around you as you reflect on where you are in life and the exciting adventures ahead of you. I just smile knowing what I've done that day and how satisfying it is to accomplish what I did.",
"Other times I do it in my room. I find cleaning my room very therapeutic. Singing in the shower also works wonders for your mental health and spirit. Just anything you want to do for fun, just do it. Sometimes I eat out by myself, and not give a crap about what other people think.",
"Spending time alone doesn't always mean happy times. There are moments when I'm sad or homesick as well. Sometimes you want to go back home or go back to when things once were. School's too stressful, your classes are too hard, life's too unfair. It's depressing I understand. During these moments, I like to go to someplace isolated and quiet at night (where you have a decent amount of privacy and peace), and just sit down. Just sit, don't do anything. If you have peaceful, classical or soft indie music, you can play those. I just sit and think about my life. Sometimes I cry a bit (I don't like to cry in front of others). I just think about my life, or stare into space. Don't be afraid to cry, you've found a private space for a reason. It's cathartic and really does solve some personal problems for you. Other times I just sigh a lot. Listen to lyrics if you want to, sometimes they are soothing. Frank Ocean once said, \"When you're happy, you enjoy the music. But when you're sad, you understand the lyrics.\" Sit there for as long as you want to or feel like. Eventually you'll feel slightly more peaceful even though nothing's been resolved. Then you'll look at the night sky and perhaps the stars. Maybe you'll look at the scenery if there is one, and you begin to appreciate the things you have. Be grateful for those things. It doesn't have to be something superficial like owning the iPhone 6, it should be gratitude for your health, your family, or the fact that you don't have that hated class tomorrow.",
"When you feel like you're ready, you can head back to your room to get cleaned up or fall asleep (sleep tends to be a major contributing factor to how happy I am).",
"Keep a Close Friend Around (or Have an Awesome Sister Like Ruby Maa)",
"I would like to run a social experiment. My sister Ruby Maa is stressed at MIT right now. She has worked so much harder than me studying Chemical Engineering in college. I think she would appreciate it if a bunch of strangers (or even just some) sent her an encouraging facebook message (via link) like \"Thanks for being such an awesome sister for James Maa. And good luck on your finals!\" would be awesome. It's just an optional request because I'm so grateful for my sister :')",
"But yes, keep a close friend around, someone you can tell all your secrets to and someone who is patient enough to listen to you complain about your daily life. Really take advantage of the network of friends you have, many of them (including myself) do have some form of interest in hearing about your problems. Find someone who's willing to listen and tell them about some of your concerns you have in life. Don't burden them with trivial stuff though, like \"OMG I hate my professor\" or milk them for compliments by saying \"OMG I'm so fat\" (which is supposed to prompt the response \"no you're not!\" followed by some compliment, but I have ceased to indulge anyone who does this to me).",
"Real life concerns I have discussed with my sister are things like \"I'm not sure if I should switch majors\" or \"Man sometimes I get really homesick\" or \"Sometimes I feel so dumb\" or \"I really want to give up and become a vagabond.\"",
"You don't have to talk to them looking for answers. Just saying out your problems out loud is enough to alleviate the stress you're experiencing. It also has the magical effect of making you and your friend closer. My sister was super supportive (in her own way) when I said, \"Man, sometimes I feel so lonely, I just can't seem to get close to anyone.\" and she just said, \"yeah, that's me for the past 2.5 years.\" And that made me feel 10 times better knowing someone is in the same situation and could sympathize.",
"Have a Role Model",
"Find someone who's someone you want to be. And it's better if your role model obtained his fame or achievements through hard work and not naturally born talent (think Steve Jobs not Lebron James). I have several role models who I can look up to. Some of  them are my friends who I won't divulge, but sometimes the personal element to it helps you understand your role models as human beings and not demi-gods.",
"Ruby's one of my role models because she probably works harder than me, sleeps less than me, and gets better grades than me. She's awesome at life even though it may seem a bit unbalanced. But knowing her as a sister I can tell that she wasn't born a MIT student, she earned it through her hard work, and she got into MIT through that despite all the hardships she faced (including being the 2nd generation asian family guinea pig). Most of my problems are trivial compared to the ones she faces everyday, and it just makes my life seem more exciting when I'm playing catch up with my sis (whom I want to beat someday).",
"Start a Blog",
"Start a blog. Get one on tumblr or wordpress. Or buy a domain name and get cheap hosting. Ask me if you have any problems with this.",
"Write two things every days that made you smile or made you grateful. Try to ignore the bad things, they usually don't deserve a spot there. The purpose isn't to attract an audience or to cave into consumer demands, it's to ensure that you are grateful and optimistic with your life every day. Small things, like a cute girl smiling your way, or finding $5 on the sidewalk could change your perspective on how your day was. Focus on the good things, the different things, and your life can seem like a series of adventures, day by day. You'll begin to ask yourself \"I wonder what exciting things will show up on my blog tomorrow\" and you'll begin to seek out adventures for yourself.",
"If you would like, you should have weekly, monthly, and yearly highlights. That way it forces you to read your blog posts. It'll really structure your semester and help you answer the question, \"What the fuck did I do during this time?\"",
"Go Outside Your Comfort Zone",
"Relieve your stress by going outside your comfort zone. As they say, \"kill the tension before the tension kills you.\" Go ask that cute girl on a date, go breakdance in your lounge, show up to class in your Stanford pajamas or banana suit. Probably not that crazy, but you get the idea, take risks, it's the thing that will make you feel alive when you feel dead for most of the day.",
"Try to do one thing that scares you every day, it'll make a difference as to how you see how you spent your life everyday. It could be \"I studied all day\" or \"I studied all day AND asked a girl out AND got flat out rejected\" (awesome! that'll be a great story to tell) or \"I studied all day AND asked a girl out AND scored a date\" FUCKING HI-FIVES! :D If you have trouble, think of this motto: \"Always make the decision that makes for a better story to tell.\"",
"If you want variety, try doing rejection therapy or the comfort challenge. It has done wonders for me.",
"Introduce Variety",
"Do something different. Flush the toilet with your left hand. Try drawing the lecturer's face onto a sphinx. Hopscotch your way down the sidewalk. Take a different route, try a different restaurant, study in a new place. Anything to break out your monotone habits (keep the good habits though!). Variety helps keep you sane because you still have traction of your time in memorable ways. One time I found out that Sproul Plaza (my university's biggest plaza and busiest) rents out tables for clubs to promote their organizations. I decided to fake being a club and rent out a table to do homework. It was so rewarding and exciting that my friend and I are starting a \"Homework on Sproul\" club for those students who want to combine the academic and social experience of college.",
"Just Take A Break",
"Sit around, go on reddit, hang out with your friends, watch tv, be unproductive every once in awhile. Usually in the moments of the highest stress we realize the things we always wanted to do in our free time, and usually it doesn't involve video games or tv. Spend some time to do these cool things. Go paintballing, hang out at the beach, or just watch a movie with some friends. You deserved it.",
"Don't study the waking hours of your dead week. Spend a bit of time to do other things as well. Just chill for an hour after a long session of work.",
"You'll feel so much more refreshed afterwards that you become more willing to tackle on new challenges.",
"Some Neat Instant Happiness",
"Compiled from my own life guide and from Reddit:",
"Waving at people in cars when I cross a crosswalk. They often smile and wave back",
"Listening to music when I eat food, it kind of sets the mood",
"When I wake up in the morning I like to roll around, curl up, and stretch like a cat in my bed.",
"Taking showers in the dark. It's so soothing",
"Smiling. Just smiling would make you happy.",
"Skipping instead of walking",
"A Caveat",
"During my productivity pursuit, I have fallen into the trap of putting a lot of my life on pause. If I imagine going back to high school, there were so many moments when I convinced myself that I couldn't enjoy my high school life because I was busy preparing for college, doing homework, or studying for tests. All those statements weren't true by the way. I always ended up not being particularly productive, and always more depressed. But the point is that I managed to miss out on so many fun and amazing opportunities in my life because I thought the only way to be a productive student was to cut out all joy and pleasure from it. It's what I was raised on anyways. My mom always told me to sacrifice your happiness now for the happiness of your future.",
"But I think it's a load of B.S. . You can be productive AND have fun at the same time. Work hard play hard. Because I have established that you must do X, Y, and Z to keep yourself sane, those act as your forms of life. These are the memories you will cherish when you are out of college. You'll remember your hard work, but the memory of the hard work is cumulative. The moments you remember most are the individual experiences, the one Friday night out, the one football game, the new thing you tried, the new girl you met. These are the stories you will be proud to tell your sons and grandsons, so don't let school get in the way."

			"title": "Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard",
			"headline": "The first question any thoughtful person might ask when reading the title of this essay is, \"Hard for whom?\"",
			"contents": [
"The first question any thoughtful person might ask when reading the title of this essay is, \"Hard for whom?\" A reasonable question. After all, Chinese people seem to learn it just fine. When little Chinese kids go through the \"terrible twos\", it's Chinese they use to drive their parents crazy, and in a few years the same kids are actually using those impossibly complicated Chinese characters to scribble love notes and shopping lists. So what do I mean by \"hard\"? Since I know at the outset that the whole tone of this document is going to involve a lot of whining and complaining, I may as well come right out and say exactly what I mean. I mean hard for me, a native English speaker trying to learn Chinese as an adult, going through the whole process with the textbooks, the tapes, the conversation partners, etc., the whole torturous rigmarole. I mean hard for me -- and, of course, for the many other Westerners who have spent years of their lives bashing their heads against the Great Wall of Chinese.",
"If this were as far as I went, my statement would be a pretty empty one. Of course Chinese is hard for me. After all, any foreign language is hard for a non-native, right? Well, sort of. Not all foreign languages are equally difficult for any learner. It depends on which language you're coming from. A French person can usually learn Italian faster than an American, and an average American could probably master German a lot faster than an average Japanese, and so on. So part of what I'm contending is that Chinese is hard compared to ... well, compared to almost any other language you might care to tackle. What I mean is that Chinese is not only hard for us (English speakers), but it's also hard in absolute terms. Which means that Chinese is also hard for them, for Chinese people.1",
"If you don't believe this, just ask a Chinese person. Most Chinese people will cheerfully acknowledge that their language is hard, maybe the hardest on earth. (Many are even proud of this, in the same way some New Yorkers are actually proud of living in the most unlivable city in America.) Maybe all Chinese people deserve a medal just for being born Chinese. At any rate, they generally become aware at some point of the Everest-like status of their native language, as they, from their privileged vantage point on the summit, observe foolhardy foreigners huffing and puffing up the steep slopes.",
"Everyone's heard the supposed fact that if you take the English idiom \"It's Greek to me\" and search for equivalent idioms in all the world's languages to arrive at a consensus as to which language is the hardest, the results of such a linguistic survey is that Chinese easily wins as the canonical incomprehensible language. (For example, the French have the expression \"C'est du chinois\", \"It's Chinese\", i.e., \"It's incomprehensible\". Other languages have similar sayings.) So then the question arises: What do the Chinese themselves consider to be an impossibly hard language? You then look for the corresponding phrase in Chinese, and you find Gēn tiānshū yíyàng 跟天书一样 meaning \"It's like heavenly script.\"",
"There is truth in this linguistic yarn; Chinese does deserve its reputation for heartbreaking difficulty. Those who undertake to study the language for any other reason than the sheer joy of it will always be frustrated by the abysmal ratio of effort to effect. Those who are actually attracted to the language precisely because of its daunting complexity and difficulty will never be disappointed. Whatever the reason they started, every single person who has undertaken to study Chinese sooner or later asks themselves \"Why in the world am I doing this?\" Those who can still remember their original goals will wisely abandon the attempt then and there, since nothing could be worth all that tedious struggle. Those who merely say \"I've come this far -- I can't stop now\" will have some chance of succeeding, since they have the kind of mindless doggedness and lack of sensible overall perspective that it takes.",
"Okay, having explained a bit of what I mean by the word, I return to my original question: Why is Chinese so damn hard?",
"1. Because the writing system is ridiculous.",
"Beautiful, complex, mysterious -- but ridiculous. I, like many students of Chinese, was first attracted to Chinese because of the writing system, which is surely one of the most fascinating scripts in the world. The more you learn about Chinese characters the more intriguing and addicting they become. The study of Chinese characters can become a lifelong obsession, and you soon find yourself engaged in the daily task of accumulating them, drop by drop from the vast sea of characters, in a vain attempt to hoard them in the leaky bucket of long-term memory.",
"The beauty of the characters is indisputable, but as the Chinese people began to realize the importance of universal literacy, it became clear that these ideograms were sort of like bound feet -- some fetishists may have liked the way they looked, but they weren't too practical for daily use.",
"For one thing, it is simply unreasonably hard to learn enough characters to become functionally literate. Again, someone may ask \"Hard in comparison to what?\" And the answer is easy: Hard in comparison to Spanish, Greek, Russian, Hindi, or any other sane, \"normal\" language that requires at most a few dozen symbols to write anything in the language. John DeFrancis, in his book The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy, reports that his Chinese colleagues estimate it takes seven to eight years for a Mandarin speaker to learn to read and write three thousand characters, whereas his French and Spanish colleagues estimate that students in their respective countries achieve comparable levels in half that time.2 Naturally, this estimate is rather crude and impressionistic (it's unclear what \"comparable levels\" means here), but the overall implications are obvious: the Chinese writing system is harder to learn, in absolute terms, than an alphabetic writing system.3 Even Chinese kids, whose minds are at their peak absorptive power, have more trouble with Chinese characters than their little counterparts in other countries have with their respective scripts. Just imagine the difficulties experienced by relatively sluggish post-pubescent foreign learners such as myself.",
"Everyone has heard that Chinese is hard because of the huge number of characters one has to learn, and this is absolutely true. There are a lot of popular books and articles that downplay this difficulty, saying things like \"Despite the fact that Chinese has [10,000, 25,000, 50,000, take your pick] separate characters you really only need 2,000 or so to read a newspaper\". Poppycock. I couldn't comfortably read a newspaper when I had 2,000 characters under my belt. I often had to look up several characters per line, and even after that I had trouble pulling the meaning out of the article. (I take it as a given that what is meant by \"read\" in this context is \"read and basically comprehend the text without having to look up dozens of characters\"; otherwise the claim is rather empty.)",
"This fairy tale is promulgated because of the fact that, when you look at the character frequencies, over 95% of the characters in any newspaper are easily among the first 2,000 most common ones.4 But what such accounts don't tell you is that there will still be plenty of unfamiliar words made up of those familiar characters. (To illustrate this problem, note that in English, knowing the words \"up\" and \"tight\" doesn't mean you know the word \"uptight\".) Plus, as anyone who has studied any language knows, you can often be familiar with every single word in a text and still not be able to grasp the meaning. Reading comprehension is not simply a matter of knowing a lot of words; one has to get a feeling for how those words combine with other words in a multitude of different contexts.5 In addition, there is the obvious fact that even though you may know 95% of the characters in a given text, the remaining 5% are often the very characters that are crucial for understanding the main point of the text. A non-native speaker of English reading an article with the headline \"JACUZZIS FOUND EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PHLEBITIS\" is not going to get very far if they don't know the words \"jacuzzi\" or \"phlebitis\".",
"The problem of reading is often a touchy one for those in the China field. How many of us would dare stand up in front of a group of colleagues and read a randomly-selected passage out loud? Yet inferiority complexes or fear of losing face causes many teachers and students to become unwitting cooperators in a kind of conspiracy of silence wherein everyone pretends that after four years of Chinese the diligent student should be whizzing through anything from Confucius to Lu Xun, pausing only occasionally to look up some pesky low-frequency character (in their Chinese-Chinese dictionary, of course). Others, of course, are more honest about the difficulties. The other day one of my fellow graduate students, someone who has been studying Chinese for ten years or more, said to me \"My research is really hampered by the fact that I still just can't read Chinese. It takes me hours to get through two or three pages, and I can't skim to save my life.\" This would be an astonishing admission for a tenth-year student of, say, French literature, yet it is a comment I hear all the time among my peers (at least in those unguarded moments when one has had a few too many Tsingtao beers and has begun to lament how slowly work on the thesis is coming).",
"A teacher of mine once told me of a game he and a colleague would sometimes play: The contest involved pulling a book at random from the shelves of the Chinese section of the Asia Library and then seeing who could be the first to figure out what the book was about. Anyone who has spent time working in an East Asia collection can verify that this can indeed be a difficult enough task -- never mind reading the book in question. This state of affairs is very disheartening for the student who is impatient to begin feasting on the vast riches of Chinese literature, but must subsist on a bland diet of canned handouts, textbook examples, and carefully edited appetizers for the first few years.",
"The comparison with learning the usual western languages is striking. After about a year of studying French, I was able to read a lot. I went through the usual kinds of novels -- La nausée by Sartre, Voltaire's Candide, L'étranger by Camus -- plus countless newspapers, magazines, comic books, etc. It was a lot of work but fairly painless; all I really needed was a good dictionary and a battered French grammar book I got at a garage sale.",
"This kind of \"sink or swim\" approach just doesn't work in Chinese. At the end of three years of learning Chinese, I hadn't yet read a single complete novel. I found it just too hard, impossibly slow, and unrewarding. Newspapers, too, were still too daunting. I couldn't read an article without looking up about every tenth character, and it was not uncommon for me to scan the front page of the People's Daily and not be able to completely decipher a single headline. Someone at that time suggested I read The Dream of the Red Chamber and gave me a nice three-volume edition. I just have to laugh. It still sits on my shelf like a fat, smug Buddha, only the first twenty or so pages filled with scribbled definitions and question marks, the rest crisp and virgin. After six years of studying Chinese, I'm still not at a level where I can actually read it without an English translation to consult. (By \"read it\", I mean, of course, \"read it for pleasure\". I suppose if someone put a gun to my head and a dictionary in my hand, I could get through it.) Simply diving into the vast pool of Chinese in the beginning is not only foolhardy, it can even be counterproductive. As George Kennedy writes, \"The difficulty of memorizing a Chinese ideograph as compared with the difficulty of learning a new word in a European language, is such that a rigid economy of mental effort is imperative.\"6 This is, if anything, an understatement. With the risk of drowning so great, the student is better advised to spend more time in the shallow end treading water before heading toward the deep end.",
"As if all this weren't bad enough, another ridiculous aspect of the Chinese writing system is that there are two (mercifully overlapping) sets of characters: the traditional characters still used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and the simplified characters adopted by the People's Republic of China in the late 1950's and early 60's. Any foreign student of Chinese is more or less forced to become familiar with both sets, since they are routinely exposed to textbooks and materials from both Chinas. This linguistic camel's-back-breaking straw puts an absurd burden on the already absurdly burdened student of Chinese, who at this point would gladly trade places with Sisyphus. But since Chinese people themselves are never equally proficient in both simplified and complex characters, there is absolutely no shame whatsoever in eventually concentrating on one set to the partial exclusion the other. In fact, there is absolutely no shame in giving up Chinese altogether, when you come right down to it.",
"2. Because the language doesn't have the common sense to use an alphabet.",
"To further explain why the Chinese writing system is so hard in this respect, it might be a good idea to spell out (no pun intended) why that of English is so easy. Imagine the kind of task faced by the average Chinese adult who decides to study English. What skills are needed to master the writing system? That's easy: 26 letters. (In upper and lower case, of course, plus script and a few variant forms. And throw in some quote marks, apostrophes, dashes, parentheses, etc. -- all things the Chinese use in their own writing system.) And how are these letters written? From left to right, horizontally, across the page, with spaces to indicate word boundaries. Forgetting for a moment the problem of spelling and actually making words out of these letters, how long does it take this Chinese learner of English to master the various components of the English writing system? Maybe a day or two.",
"Now consider the American undergraduate who decides to study Chinese. What does it take for this person to master the Chinese writing system? There is nothing that corresponds to an alphabet, though there are recurring components that make up the characters. How many such components are there? Don't ask. As with all such questions about Chinese, the answer is very messy and unsatisfying. It depends on how you define \"component\" (strokes? radicals?), plus a lot of other tedious details. Suffice it to say, the number is quite large, vastly more than the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet. And how are these components combined to form characters? Well, you name it -- components to the left of other components, to the right of other components, on top of other components, surrounding other components, inside of other components -- almost anything is possible. And in the process of making these spatial accommodations, these components get flattened, stretched, squashed, shortened, and distorted in order to fit in the uniform square space that all characters are supposed to fit into. In other words, the components of Chinese characters are arrayed in two dimensions, rather than in the neat one-dimensional rows of alphabetic writing.",
"Okay, so ignoring for the moment the question of elegance, how long does it take a Westerner to learn the Chinese writing system so that when confronted with any new character they at least know how to move the pen around in order to produce a reasonable facsimile of that character? Again, hard to say, but I would estimate that it takes the average learner several months of hard work to get the basics down. Maybe a year or more if they're a klutz who was never very good in art class. Meanwhile, their Chinese counterpart learning English has zoomed ahead to learn cursive script, with time left over to read Moby Dick, or at least Strunk & White.",
"This is not exactly big news, I know; the alphabet really is a breeze to learn. Chinese people I know who have studied English for a few years can usually write with a handwriting style that is almost indistinguishable from that of the average American. Very few Americans, on the other hand, ever learn to produce a natural calligraphic hand in Chinese that resembles anything but that of an awkward Chinese third-grader. If there were nothing else hard about Chinese, the task of learning to write characters alone would put it in the rogues' gallery of hard-to-learn languages.",
"3. Because the writing system just ain't very phonetic.",
"So much for the physical process of writing the characters themselves. What about the sheer task of memorizing so many characters? Again, a comparison of English and Chinese is instructive. Suppose a Chinese person has just the previous day learned the English word \"president\", and now wants to write it from memory. How to start? Anyone with a year or two of English experience is going to have a host of clues and spelling rules-of-thumb, albeit imperfect ones, to help them along. The word really couldn't start with anything but \"pr\", and after that a little guesswork aided by visual memory (\"Could a 'z' be in there? That's an unusual letter, I would have noticed it, I think. Must be an 's'...\") should produce something close to the target. Not every foreigner (or native speaker for that matter) has noted or internalized the various flawed spelling heuristics of English, of course, but they are at least there to be utilized.",
"Now imagine that you, a learner of Chinese, have just the previous day encountered the Chinese word for \"president\" (总统 zǒngtǒng ) and want to write it. What processes do you go through in retrieving the word? Well, very often you just totally forget, with a forgetting that is both absolute and perfect in a way few things in this life are. You can repeat the word as often as you like; the sound won't give you a clue as to how the character is to be written. After you learn a few more characters and get hip to a few more phonetic components, you can do a bit better. (\"Zǒng 总 is a phonetic component in some other character, right?...Song? Zeng? Oh yeah, cong 总 as in cōngmíng 聪明.\") Of course, the phonetic aspect of some characters is more obvious than that of others, but many characters, including some of the most high-frequency ones, give no clue at all as to their pronunciation.",
"All of this is to say that Chinese is just not very phonetic when compared to English. (English, in turn, is less phonetic than a language like German or Spanish, but Chinese isn't even in the same ballpark.) It is not true, as some people outside the field tend to think, that Chinese is not phonetic at all, though a perfectly intelligent beginning student could go several months without noticing this fact. Just how phonetic the language is a very complex issue. Educated opinions range from 25% (Zhao Yuanren)7 to around 66% (DeFrancis),8 though the latter estimate assumes more knowledge of phonetic components than most learners are likely to have. One could say that Chinese is phonetic in the way that sex is aerobic: technically so, but in practical use not the most salient thing about it. Furthermore, this phonetic aspect of the language doesn't really become very useful until you've learned a few hundred characters, and even when you've learned two thousand, the feeble phoneticity of Chinese will never provide you with the constant memory prod that the phonetic quality of English does.",
"Which means that often you just completely forget how to write a character. Period. If there is no obvious semantic clue in the radical, and no helpful phonetic component somewhere in the character, you're just sunk. And you're sunk whether your native language is Chinese or not; contrary to popular myth, Chinese people are not born with the ability to memorize arbitrary squiggles. In fact, one of the most gratifying experiences a foreign student of Chinese can have is to see a native speaker come up a complete blank when called upon to write the characters for some relatively common word. You feel an enormous sense of vindication and relief to see a native speaker experience the exact same difficulty you experience every day.",
"This is such a gratifying experience, in fact, that I have actually kept a list of characters that I have observed Chinese people forget how to write. (A sick, obsessive activity, I know.) I have seen highly literate Chinese people forget how to write certain characters in common words like \"tin can\", \"knee\", \"screwdriver\", \"snap\" (as in \"to snap one's fingers\"), \"elbow\", \"ginger\", \"cushion\", \"firecracker\", and so on. And when I say \"forget\", I mean that they often cannot even put the first stroke down on the paper. Can you imagine a well-educated native English speaker totally forgetting how to write a word like \"knee\" or \"tin can\"? Or even a rarely-seen word like \"scabbard\" or \"ragamuffin\"? I was once at a luncheon with three Ph.D. students in the Chinese Department at Peking University, all native Chinese (one from Hong Kong). I happened to have a cold that day, and was trying to write a brief note to a friend canceling an appointment that day. I found that I couldn't remember how to write the character 嚔, as in da penti 打喷嚔 \"to sneeze\". I asked my three friends how to write the character, and to my surprise, all three of them simply shrugged in sheepish embarrassment. Not one of them could correctly produce the character. Now, Peking University is usually considered the \"Harvard of China\". Can you imagine three Ph.D. students in English at Harvard forgetting how to write the English word \"sneeze\"?? Yet this state of affairs is by no means uncommon in China. English is simply orders of magnitude easier to write and remember. No matter how low-frequency the word is, or how unorthodox the spelling, the English speaker can always come up with something, simply because there has to be some correspondence between sound and spelling. One might forget whether \"abracadabra\" is hyphenated or not, or get the last few letters wrong on \"rhinoceros\", but even the poorest of spellers can make a reasonable stab at almost anything. By contrast, often even the most well-educated Chinese have no recourse but to throw up their hands and ask someone else in the room how to write some particularly elusive character.",
"As one mundane example of the advantages of a phonetic writing system, here is one kind of linguistic situation I encountered constantly while I was in France. (Again I use French as my canonical example of an \"easy\" foreign language.) I wake up one morning in Paris and turn on the radio. An ad comes on, and I hear the word \"amortisseur\" several times. \"What's an amortisseur?\" I think to myself, but as I am in a hurry to make an appointment, I forget to look the word up in my haste to leave the apartment. A few hours later I'm walking down the street, and I read, on a sign, the word \"AMORTISSEUR\" -- the word I heard earlier this morning. Beneath the word on the sign is a picture of a shock absorber. Aha! So \"amortisseur\" means \"shock absorber\". And voila! I've learned a new word, quickly and painlessly, all because the sound I construct when reading the word is the same as the sound in my head from the radio this morning -- one reinforces the other. Throughout the next week I see the word again several times, and each time I can reconstruct the sound by simply reading the word phonetically -- \"a-mor-tis-seur\". Before long I can retrieve the word easily, use it in conversation, or write it in a letter to a friend. And the process of learning a foreign language begins to seem less daunting.",
"When I first went to Taiwan for a few months, the situation was quite different. I was awash in a sea of characters that were all visually interesting but phonetically mute. I carried around a little dictionary to look up unfamiliar characters in, but it's almost impossible to look up a character in a Chinese dictionary while walking along a crowded street (more on dictionary look-up later), and so I didn't get nearly as much phonetic reinforcement as I got in France. In Taiwan I could pass a shop with a sign advertising shock absorbers and never know how to pronounce any of the characters unless I first look them up. And even then, the next time I pass the shop I might have to look the characters up again. And again, and again. The reinforcement does not come naturally and easily.",
"4. Because you can't cheat by using cognates.",
"I remember when I had been studying Chinese very hard for about three years, I had an interesting experience. One day I happened to find a Spanish-language newspaper sitting on a seat next to me. I picked it up out of curiosity. \"Hmm,\" I thought to myself. \"I've never studied Spanish in my life. I wonder how much of this I can understand.\" At random I picked a short article about an airplane crash and started to read. I found I could basically glean, with some guesswork, most of the information from the article. The crash took place near Los Angeles. 186 people were killed. There were no survivors. The plane crashed just one minute after take-off. There was nothing on the flight recorder to indicate a critical situation, and the tower was unaware of any emergency. The plane had just been serviced three days before and no mechanical problems had been found. And so on. After finishing the article I had a sudden discouraging realization: Having never studied a day of Spanish, I could read a Spanish newspaper more easily than I could a Chinese newspaper after more than three years of studying Chinese.",
"What was going on here? Why was this \"foreign\" language so transparent? The reason was obvious: cognates -- those helpful words that are just English words with a little foreign make-up.9 I could read the article because most of the operative words were basically English: aeropuerto, problema mechanico, un minuto, situacion critica, emergencia, etc. Recognizing these words as just English words in disguise is about as difficult as noticing that Superman is really Clark Kent without his glasses. That these quasi-English words are easier to learn than Chinese characters (which might as well be quasi-Martian) goes without saying.",
"Imagine you are a diabetic, and you find yourself in Spain about to go into insulin shock. You can rush into a doctor's office, and, with a minimum of Spanish and a couple of pieces of guesswork (\"diabetes\" is just \"diabetes\" and \"insulin\" is \"insulina\", it turns out), you're saved. In China you'd be a goner for sure, unless you happen to have a dictionary with you, and even then you would probably pass out while frantically looking for the first character in the word for insulin. Which brings me to the next reason why Chinese is so hard.",
"5. Because even looking up a word in the dictionary is complicated.",
"One of the most unreasonably difficult things about learning Chinese is that merely learning how to look up a word in the dictionary is about the equivalent of an entire semester of secretarial school. When I was in Taiwan, I heard that they sometimes held dictionary look-up contests in the junior high schools. Imagine a language where simply looking a word up in the dictionary is considered a skill like debate or volleyball! Chinese is not exactly what you would call a user-friendly language, but a Chinese dictionary is positively user-hostile.",
"Figuring out all the radicals and their variants, plus dealing with the ambiguous characters with no obvious radical at all is a stupid, time-consuming chore that slows the learning process down by a factor of ten as compared to other languages with a sensible alphabet or the equivalent. I'd say it took me a good year before I could reliably find in the dictionary any character I might encounter. And to this day, I will very occasionally stumble onto a character that I simply can't find at all, even after ten minutes of searching. At such times I raise my hands to the sky, Job-like, and consider going into telemarketing.",
"Chinese must also be one of the most dictionary-intensive languages on earth. I currently have more than twenty Chinese dictionaries of various kinds on my desk, and they all have a specific and distinct use. There are dictionaries with simplified characters used on the mainland, dictionaries with the traditional characters used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and dictionaries with both. There are dictionaries that use the Wade-Giles romanization, dictionaries that use pinyin, and dictionaries that use other more surrealistic romanization methods. There are dictionaries of classical Chinese particles, dictionaries of Beijing dialect, dictionaries of chéngyǔ (four-character idioms), dictionaries of xiēhòuyǔ (special allegorical two-part sayings), dictionaries of yànyǔ (proverbs), dictionaries of Chinese communist terms, dictionaries of Buddhist terms, reverse dictionaries... on and on. An exhaustive hunt for some elusive or problematic lexical item can leave one's desk \"strewn with dictionaries as numerous as dead soldiers on a battlefield.\"10",
"For looking up unfamiliar characters there is another method called the four-corner system. This method is very fast -- rumored to be, in principle, about as fast as alphabetic look-up (though I haven't met anyone yet who can hit the winning number each time on the first try). Unfortunately, learning this method takes about as much time and practice as learning the Dewey decimal system. Plus you are then at the mercy of the few dictionaries that are arranged according to the numbering scheme of the four-corner system. Those who have mastered this system usually swear by it. The rest of us just swear.",
"Another problem with looking up words in the dictionary has to do with the nature of written Chinese. In most languages it's pretty obvious where the word boundaries lie -- there are spaces between the words. If you don't know the word in question, it's usually fairly clear what you should look up. (What actually constitutes a word is a very subtle issue, of course, but for my purposes here, what I'm saying is basically correct.) In Chinese there are spaces between characters, but it takes quite a lot of knowledge of the language and often some genuine sleuth work to tell where word boundaries lie; thus it's often trial and error to look up a word. It would be as if English were written thus:",
"FEAR LESS LY OUT SPOKE N BUT SOME WHAT HUMOR LESS NEW ENG LAND BORN LEAD ACT OR GEORGE MICHAEL SON EX PRESS ED OUT RAGE TO DAY AT THE STALE MATE BE TWEEN MAN AGE MENT AND THE ACT OR 'S UNION BE CAUSE THE STAND OFF HAD SET BACK THE TIME TABLE FOR PRO DUC TION OF HIS PLAY, A ONE MAN SHOW CASE THAT WAS HIS FIRST RUN A WAY BROAD WAY BOX OFFICE SMASH HIT. \"THE FIRST A MEND MENT IS AT IS SUE\" HE PRO CLAIM ED. \"FOR A CENS OR OR AN EDIT OR TO EDIT OR OTHER WISE BLUE PENCIL QUESTION ABLE DIA LOG JUST TO KOW TOW TO RIGHT WING BORN AGAIN BIBLE THUMP ING FRUIT CAKE S IS A DOWN RIGHT DIS GRACE.\"",
"Imagine how this difference would compound the dictionary look-up difficulties of a non-native speaker of English. The passage is pretty trivial for us to understand, but then we already know English. For them it would often be hard to tell where the word boundaries were supposed to be. So it is, too, with someone trying to learn Chinese.",
"6. Then there's classical Chinese (wenyanwen).",
"Forget it. Way too difficult. If you think that after three or four years of study you'll be breezing through Confucius and Mencius in the way third-year French students at a comparable level are reading Diderot and Voltaire, you're sadly mistaken. There are some westerners who can comfortably read classical Chinese, but most of them have a lot of gray hair or at least tenure.",
"Unfortunately, classical Chinese pops up everywhere, especially in Chinese paintings and character scrolls, and most people will assume anyone literate in Chinese can read it. It's truly embarrassing to be out at a Chinese restaurant, and someone asks you to translate some characters on a wall hanging.",
"\"Hey, you speak Chinese. What does this scroll say?\" You look up and see that the characters are written in wenyan, and in incomprehensible \"grass-style\" calligraphy to boot. It might as well be an EKG readout of a dying heart patient.",
"\"Uh, I can make out one or two of the characters, but I couldn't tell you what it says,\" you stammer. \"I think it's about a phoenix or something.\"",
"\"Oh, I thought you knew Chinese,\" says your friend, returning to their menu. Never mind that an honest-to-goodness Chinese person would also just scratch their head and shrug; the face that is lost is yours.",
"Whereas modern Mandarin is merely perversely hard, classical Chinese is deliberately impossible. Here's a secret that sinologists won't tell you: A passage in classical Chinese can be understood only if you already know what the passage says in the first place. This is because classical Chinese really consists of several centuries of esoteric anecdotes and in-jokes written in a kind of terse, miserly code for dissemination among a small, elite group of intellectually-inbred bookworms who already knew the whole literature backwards and forwards, anyway. An uninitiated westerner can no more be expected to understand such writing than Confucius himself, if transported to the present, could understand the entries in the \"personal\" section of the classified ads that say things like: \"Hndsm. SWGM, 24, 160, sks BGM or WGM for gentle S&M, mod. bndg., some lthr., twosm or threesm ok, have own equip., wheels, 988-8752 lv. mssg. on ans. mach., no weirdos please.\"",
"In fairness, it should be said that classical Chinese gets easier the more you attempt it. But then so does hitting a hole in one, or swimming the English channel in a straitjacket.",
"7. Because there are too many romanization methods and they all suck.",
"Well, perhaps that's too harsh. But it is true that there are too many of them, and most of them were designed either by committee or by linguists, or -- even worse -- by a committee of linguists. It is, of course, a very tricky task to devise a romanization method; some are better than others, but all involve plenty of counterintuitive spellings.11 And if you're serious about a career in Chinese, you'll have to grapple with at least four or five of them, not including the bopomofu phonetic symbols used in Taiwan. There are probably a dozen or more romanization schemes out there somewhere, most of them mercifully obscure and rightfully ignored. There is a standing joke among sinologists that one of the first signs of senility in a China scholar is the compulsion to come up with a new romanization method.",
"8. Because tonal languages are weird.",
"Okay, that's very Anglo-centric, I know it. But I have to mention this problem because it's one of the most common complaints about learning Chinese, and it's one of the aspects of the language that westerners are notoriously bad at. Every person who tackles Chinese at first has a little trouble believing this aspect of the language. How is it possible that shùxué means \"mathematics\" while shūxuě means \"blood transfusion\", or that guòjiǎng means \"you flatter me\" while guǒjiàng means \"fruit paste\"?",
"By itself, this property of Chinese would be hard enough; it means that, for us non-native speakers, there is this extra, seemingly irrelevant aspect of the sound of a word that you must memorize along with the vowels and consonants. But where the real difficulty comes in is when you start to really use Chinese to express yourself. You suddenly find yourself straitjacketed -- when you say the sentence with the intonation that feels natural, the tones come out all wrong. For example, if you wish say something like \"Hey, that's my water glass you're drinking out of!\", and you follow your intonational instincts -- that is, to put a distinct falling tone on the first character of the word for \"my\" -- you will have said a kind of gibberish that may or may not be understood.",
"Intonation and stress habits are incredibly ingrained and second-nature. With non-tonal languages you can basically import, mutatis mutandis, your habitual ways of emphasizing, negating, stressing, and questioning. The results may be somewhat non-native but usually understandable. Not so with Chinese, where your intonational contours must always obey the tonal constraints of the specific words you've chosen. Chinese speakers, of course, can express all of the intonational subtleties available in non-tonal languages -- it's just that they do it in a way that is somewhat alien to us speakers of non-tonal languages. When you first begin using your Chinese to talk about subjects that actually matter to you, you find that it feels somewhat like trying to have a passionate argument with your hands tied behind your back -- you are suddenly robbed of some vital expressive tools you hadn't even been aware of having.",
"9. Because east is east and west is west, and the twain have only recently met.",
"Language and culture cannot be separated, of course, and one of the main reasons Chinese is so difficult for Americans is that our two cultures have been isolated for so long. The reason reading French sentences like \"Le président Bush assure le peuple koweitien que le gouvernement américain va continuer à défendre le Koweit contre la menace irakienne,\" is about as hard as deciphering pig Latin is not just because of the deep Indo-European family resemblance, but also because the core concepts and cultural assumptions in such utterances stem from the same source. We share the same art history, the same music history, the same history history -- which means that in the head of a French person there is basically the same set of archetypes and the same cultural cast of characters that's in an American's head. We are as familiar with Rimbaud as they are with Rambo. In fact, compared to the difference between China and the U.S., American culture and and French culture seem about as different as Peter Pan and Skippy peanut butter.",
"Speaking with a Chinese person is usually a different matter. You just can't drop Dickens, Tarzan, Jack the Ripper, Goethe, or the Beatles into a conversation and always expect to be understood. I once had a Chinese friend who had read the first translations of Kafka into Chinese, yet didn't know who Santa Claus was. China has had extensive contact with the West in the last few decades, but there is still a vast sea of knowledge and ideas that is not shared by both cultures.",
"Similarly, how many Americans other than sinophiles have even a rough idea of the chronology of China's dynasties? Has the average history major here ever heard of Qin Shi Huangdi and his contribution to Chinese culture? How many American music majors have ever heard a note of Peking Opera, or would recognize a pipa if they tripped over one? How many otherwise literate Americans have heard of Lu Xun, Ba Jin, or even Mozi?",
"What this means is that when Americans and Chinese get together, there is often not just a language barrier, but an immense cultural barrier as well. Of course, this is one of the reasons the study of Chinese is so interesting. It is also one of the reasons it is so damn hard.",
"Conclusion",
"I could go on and on, but I figure if the reader has bothered to read this far, I'm preaching to the converted, anyway. Those who have tackled other difficult languages have their own litany of horror stories, I'm sure. But I still feel reasonably confident in asserting that, for an average American, Chinese is significantly harder to learn than any of the other thirty or so major world languages that are usually studied formally at the university level (though Japanese in many ways comes close). Not too interesting for linguists, maybe, but something to consider if you've decided to better yourself by learning a foreign language, and you're thinking \"Gee, Chinese looks kinda neat.\"",
"It's pretty hard to quantify a process as complex and multi-faceted as language-learning, but one simple metric is to simply estimate the time it takes to master the requisite language-learning skills. When you consider all the above-mentioned things a learner of Chinese has to acquire -- ability to use a dictionary, familiarity with two or three romanization methods, a grasp of principles involved in writing characters (both simplified and traditional) -- it adds up to an awful lot of down time while one is \"learning to learn\" Chinese.",
"How much harder is Chinese? Again, I'll use French as my canonical \"easy language\". This is a very rough and intuitive estimate, but I would say that it takes about three times as long to reach a level of comfortable fluency in speaking, reading, and writing Chinese as it takes to reach a comparable level in French. An average American could probably become reasonably fluent in two Romance languages in the time it would take them to reach the same level in Chinese.",
"One could perhaps view learning languages as being similar to learning musical instruments. Despite the esoteric glories of the harmonica literature, it's probably safe to say that the piano is a lot harder and more time-consuming to learn. To extend the analogy, there is also the fact that we are all virtuosos on at least one \"instrument\" (namely, our native language), and learning instruments from the same family is easier than embarking on a completely different instrument. A Spanish person learning Portuguese is comparable to a violinist taking up the viola, whereas an American learning Chinese is more like a rock guitarist trying to learn to play an elaborate 30-stop three-manual pipe organ.",
"Someone once said that learning Chinese is \"a five-year lesson in humility\". I used to think this meant that at the end of five years you will have mastered Chinese and learned humility along the way. However, now having studied Chinese for over six years, I have concluded that actually the phrase means that after five years your Chinese will still be abysmal, but at least you will have thoroughly learned humility.",
"There is still the awe-inspiring fact that Chinese people manage to learn their own language very well. Perhaps they are like the gradeschool kids that Baroque performance groups recruit to sing Bach cantatas. The story goes that someone in the audience, amazed at hearing such youthful cherubs flawlessly singing Bach's uncompromisingly difficult vocal music, asks the choir director, \"But how are they able to perform such difficult music?\"",
"\"Shh -- not so loud!\" says the director, \"If you don't tell them it's difficult, they never know.\"",

"Thomas (his middle name) is a fifth-grader at the highly competitive P.S. 334, the Anderson School on West 84th. Slim as they get, Thomas recently had his long sandy-blond hair cut short to look like the new James Bond (he took a photo of Daniel Craig to the barber). Unlike Bond, he prefers a uniform of cargo pants and a T-shirt emblazoned with a photo of one of his heroes: Frank Zappa. Thomas hangs out with five friends from the Anderson School. They are \"the smart kids.\" Thomas's one of them, and he likes belonging.",
"Since Thomas could walk, he has heard constantly that he's smart. Not just from his parents but from any adult who has come in contact with this precocious child. When he applied to Anderson for kindergarten, his intelligence was statistically confirmed. The school is reserved for the top one percent of all applicants, and an IQ test is required. Thomas didn't just score in the top one percent. He scored in the top one percent of the top one percent.",
"But as Thomas has progressed through school, this self-awareness that he's smart hasn't always translated into fearless confidence when attacking his schoolwork. In fact, Thomas's father noticed just the opposite. \"Thomas didn't want to try things he wouldn't be successful at,\" his father says. \"Some things came very quickly to him, but when they didn't, he gave up almost immediately, concluding, 'I'm not good at this.' \" With no more than a glance, Thomas was dividing the world into two—things he was naturally good at and things he wasn't.",
"For instance, in the early grades, Thomas wasn't very good at spelling, so he simply demurred from spelling out loud. When Thomas took his first look at fractions, he balked. The biggest hurdle came in third grade. He was supposed to learn cursive penmanship, but he wouldn't even try for weeks. By then, his teacher was demanding homework be completed in cursive. Rather than play catch-up on his penmanship, Thomas refused outright. Thomas's father tried to reason with him. \"Look, just because you're smart doesn't mean you don't have to put out some effort.\" (Eventually, he mastered cursive, but not without a lot of cajoling from his father.)",
"Why does this child, who is measurably at the very top of the charts, lack confidence about his ability to tackle routine school challenges?",
"Thomas is not alone. For a few decades, it's been noted that a large percentage of all gifted students (those who score in the top 10 percent on aptitude tests) severely underestimate their own abilities. Those afflicted with this lack of perceived competence adopt lower standards for success and expect less of themselves. They underrate the importance of effort, and they overrate how much help they need from a parent.",
"When parents praise their children's intelligence, they believe they are providing the solution to this problem. According to a survey conducted by Columbia University, 85 percent of American parents think it's important to tell their kids that they're smart. In and around the New York area, according to my own (admittedly nonscientific) poll, the number is more like 100 percent. Everyone does it, habitually. The constant praise is meant to be an angel on the shoulder, ensuring that children do not sell their talents short.",
"But a growing body of research—and a new study from the trenches of the New York public-school system—strongly suggests it might be the other way around. Giving kids the label of \"smart\" does not prevent them from underperforming. It might actually be causing it.",
"For the past ten years, psychologist Carol Dweck and her team at Columbia (she's now at Stanford) studied the effect of praise on students in a dozen New York schools. Her seminal work—a series of experiments on 400 fifth-graders—paints the picture most clearly.",
"Dweck sent four female research assistants into New York fifth-grade classrooms. The researchers would take a single child out of the classroom for a nonverbal IQ test consisting of a series of puzzles—puzzles easy enough that all the children would do fairly well. Once the child finished the test, the researchers told each student his score, then gave him a single line of praise. Randomly divided into groups, some were praised for their intelligence. They were told, \"You must be smart at this.\" Other students were praised for their effort: \"You must have worked really hard.\"",
"Why just a single line of praise? \"We wanted to see how sensitive children were,\" Dweck explained. \"We had a hunch that one line might be enough to see an effect.\"",
"Then the students were given a choice of test for the second round. One choice was a test that would be more difficult than the first, but the researchers told the kids that they'd learn a lot from attempting the puzzles. The other choice, Dweck's team explained, was an easy test, just like the first. Of those praised for their effort, 90 percent chose the harder set of puzzles. Of those praised for their intelligence, a majority chose the easy test. The \"smart\" kids took the cop-out.",
"Why did this happen? \"When we praise children for their intelligence,\" Dweck wrote in her study summary, \"we tell them that this is the name of the game: Look smart, don't risk making mistakes.\" And that's what the fifth-graders had done: They'd chosen to look smart and avoid the risk of being embarrassed.",
"In a subsequent round, none of the fifth-graders had a choice. The test was difficult, designed for kids two years ahead of their grade level. Predictably, everyone failed. But again, the two groups of children, divided at random at the study's start, responded differently. Those praised for their effort on the first test assumed they simply hadn't focused hard enough on this test. \"They got very involved, willing to try every solution to the puzzles,\" Dweck recalled. \"Many of them remarked, unprovoked, 'This is my favorite test.' \" Not so for those praised for their smarts. They assumed their failure was evidence that they weren't really smart at all. \"Just watching them, you could see the strain. They were sweating and miserable.\"",
"Having artificially induced a round of failure, Dweck's researchers then gave all the fifth-graders a final round of tests that were engineered to be as easy as the first round. Those who had been praised for their effort significantly improved on their first score—by about 30 percent. Those who'd been told they were smart did worse than they had at the very beginning—by about 20 percent.",
"Dweck had suspected that praise could backfire, but even she was surprised by the magnitude of the effect. \"Emphasizing effort gives a child a variable that they can control,\" she explains. \"They come to see themselves as in control of their success. Emphasizing natural intelligence takes it out of the child's control, and it provides no good recipe for responding to a failure.\"",
"In follow-up interviews, Dweck discovered that those who think that innate intelligence is the key to success begin to discount the importance of effort. I am smart, the kids' reasoning goes; I don't need to put out effort. Expending effort becomes stigmatized—it's public proof that you can't cut it on your natural gifts.",
"Repeating her experiments, Dweck found this effect of praise on performance held true for students of every socioeconomic class. It hit both boys and girls—the very brightest girls especially (they collapsed the most following failure). Even preschoolers weren't immune to the inverse power of praise.",
"Jill Abraham is a mother of three in Scarsdale, and her view is typical of those in my straw poll. I told her about Dweck's research on praise, and she flatly wasn't interested in brief tests without long-term follow-up. Abraham is one of the 85 percent who think praising her children's intelligence is important. Her kids are thriving, so she's proved that praise works in the real world. \"I don't care what the experts say,\" Jill says defiantly. \"I'm living it.\"",
"Even those who've accepted the new research on praise have trouble putting it into practice. Sue Needleman is both a mother of two and an elementary-school teacher with eleven years' experience. Last year, she was a fourth-grade teacher at Ridge Ranch Elementary in Paramus, New Jersey. She has never heard of Carol Dweck, but the gist of Dweck's research has trickled down to her school, and Needleman has learned to say, \"I like how you keep trying.\" She tries to keep her praise specific, rather than general, so that a child knows exactly what she did to earn the praise (and thus can get more). She will occasionally tell a child, \"You're good at math,\" but she'll never tell a child he's bad at math.",
"But that's at school, as a teacher. At home, old habits die hard. Her 8-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son are indeed smart, and sometimes she hears herself saying, \"You're great. You did it. You're smart.\" When I press her on this, Needleman says that what comes out of academia often feels artificial. \"When I read the mock dialogues, my first thought is, Oh, please. How corny.\"",
"No such qualms exist for teachers at the Life Sciences Secondary School in East Harlem, because they've seen Dweck's theories applied to their junior-high students. Last week, Dweck and her protégée, Lisa Blackwell, published a report in the academic journal Child Development about the effect of a semester-long intervention conducted to improve students' math scores.",
"Life Sciences is a health-science magnet school with high aspirations but 700 students whose main attributes are being predominantly minority and low achieving. Blackwell split her kids into two groups for an eight-session workshop. The control group was taught study skills, and the others got study skills and a special module on how intelligence is not innate. These students took turns reading aloud an essay on how the brain grows new neurons when challenged. They saw slides of the brain and acted out skits. \"Even as I was teaching these ideas,\" Blackwell noted, \"I would hear the students joking, calling one another 'dummy' or 'stupid.' \" After the module was concluded, Blackwell tracked her students' grades to see if it had any effect.",
"It didn't take long. The teachers—who hadn't known which students had been assigned to which workshop—could pick out the students who had been taught that intelligence can be developed. They improved their study habits and grades. In a single semester, Blackwell reversed the students' longtime trend of decreasing math grades.",
"The only difference between the control group and the test group were two lessons, a total of 50 minutes spent teaching not math but a single idea: that the brain is a muscle. Giving it a harder workout makes you smarter. That alone improved their math scores.",
"\"These are very persuasive findings,\" says Columbia's Dr. Geraldine Downey, a specialist in children's sensitivity to rejection. \"They show how you can take a specific theory and develop a curriculum that works.\" Downey's comment is typical of what other scholars in the field are saying. Dr. Mahzarin Banaji, a Harvard social psychologist who is an expert in stereotyping, told me, \"Carol Dweck is a flat-out genius. I hope the work is taken seriously. It scares people when they see these results.\"",
"Since the 1969 publication of The Psychology of Self-Esteem, in which Nathaniel Branden opined that self-esteem was the single most important facet of a person, the belief that one must do whatever he can to achieve positive self-esteem has become a movement with broad societal effects. Anything potentially damaging to kids' self-esteem was axed. Competitions were frowned upon. Soccer coaches stopped counting goals and handed out trophies to everyone. Teachers threw out their red pencils. Criticism was replaced with ubiquitous, even undeserved, praise.",
"Dweck and Blackwell's work is part of a larger academic challenge to one of the self-esteem movement's key tenets: that praise, self-esteem, and performance rise and fall together. From 1970 to 2000, there were over 15,000 scholarly articles written on self-esteem and its relationship to everything—from sex to career advancement. But results were often contradictory or inconclusive. So in 2003 the Association for Psychological Science asked Dr. Roy Baumeister, then a leading proponent of self-esteem, to review this literature. His team concluded that self-esteem was polluted with flawed science. Only 200 of those 15,000 studies met their rigorous standards.",
"I am smart, the kids' reasoning goes; I don't need to put out effort. Expending effort becomes stigmatized—it's public proof that you can't cut it on your natural gifts.",
"After reviewing those 200 studies, Baumeister concluded that having high self-esteem didn't improve grades or career achievement. It didn't even reduce alcohol usage. And it especially did not lower violence of any sort. (Highly aggressive, violent people happen to think very highly of themselves, debunking the theory that people are aggressive to make up for low self-esteem.) At the time, Baumeister was quoted as saying that his findings were \"the biggest disappointment of my career.\"",
"Now he's on Dweck's side of the argument, and his work is going in a similar direction: He will soon publish an article showing that for college students on the verge of failing in class, esteem-building praise causes their grades to sink further. Baumeister has come to believe the continued appeal of self-esteem is largely tied to parents' pride in their children's achievements: It's so strong that \"when they praise their kids, it's not that far from praising themselves.\"",
"By and large, the literature on praise shows that it can be effective—a positive, motivating force. In one study, University of Notre Dame researchers tested praise's efficacy on a losing college hockey team. The experiment worked: The team got into the playoffs. But all praise is not equal—and, as Dweck demonstrated, the effects of praise can vary significantly depending on the praise given. To be effective, researchers have found, praise needs to be specific. (The hockey players were specifically complimented on the number of times they checked an opponent.)",
"Sincerity of praise is also crucial. Just as we can sniff out the true meaning of a backhanded compliment or a disingenuous apology, children, too, scrutinize praise for hidden agendas. Only young children—under the age of 7—take praise at face value: Older children are just as suspicious of it as adults.",
"Psychologist Wulf-Uwe Meyer, a pioneer in the field, conducted a series of studies where children watched other students receive praise. According to Meyer's findings, by the age of 12, children believe that earning praise from a teacher is not a sign you did well—it's actually a sign you lack ability and the teacher thinks you need extra encouragement. And teens, Meyer found, discounted praise to such an extent that they believed it's a teacher's criticism—not praise at all—that really conveys a positive belief in a student's aptitude.",
"In the opinion of cognitive scientist Daniel T. Willingham, a teacher who praises a child may be unwittingly sending the message that the student reached the limit of his innate ability, while a teacher who criticizes a pupil conveys the message that he can improve his performance even further.",
"New York University professor of psychiatry Judith Brook explains that the issue for parents is one of credibility. \"Praise is important, but not vacuous praise,\" she says. \"It has to be based on a real thing—some skill or talent they have.\" Once children hear praise they interpret as meritless, they discount not just the insincere praise, but sincere praise as well.",
"Scholars from Reed College and Stanford reviewed over 150 praise studies. Their meta-analysis determined that praised students become risk-averse and lack perceived autonomy. The scholars found consistent correlations between a liberal use of praise and students' \"shorter task persistence, more eye-checking with the teacher, and inflected speech such that answers have the intonation of questions.\"",
"Dweck's research on overpraised kids strongly suggests that image maintenance becomes their primary concern—they are more competitive and more interested in tearing others down. A raft of very alarming studies illustrate this.",
"In one, students are given two puzzle tests. Between the first and the second, they are offered a choice between learning a new puzzle strategy for the second test or finding out how they did compared with other students on the first test: They have only enough time to do one or the other. Students praised for intelligence choose to find out their class rank, rather than use the time to prepare.",
"In another, students get a do-it-yourself report card and are told these forms will be mailed to students at another school—they'll never meet these students and don't know their names. Of the kids praised for their intelligence, 40 percent lie, inflating their scores. Of the kids praised for effort, few lie.",
"When students transition into junior high, some who'd done well in elementary school inevitably struggle in the larger and more demanding environment. Those who equated their earlier success with their innate ability surmise they've been dumb all along. Their grades never recover because the likely key to their recovery—increasing effort—they view as just further proof of their failure. In interviews many confess they would \"seriously consider cheating.\"",
"Students turn to cheating because they haven't developed a strategy for handling failure. The problem is compounded when a parent ignores a child's failures and insists he'll do better next time. Michigan scholar Jennifer Crocker studies this exact scenario and explains that the child may come to believe failure is something so terrible, the family can't acknowledge its existence. A child deprived of the opportunity to discuss mistakes can't learn from them.",
"My son, Luke, is in kindergarten. He seems supersensitive to the potential judgment of his peers. Luke justifies it by saying, \"I'm shy,\" but he's not really shy. He has no fear of strange cities or talking to strangers, and at his school, he has sung in front of large audiences. Rather, I'd say he's proud and self-conscious. His school has simple uniforms (navy T-shirt, navy pants), and he loves that his choice of clothes can't be ridiculed, \"because then they'd be teasing themselves too.\"",
"After reading Carol Dweck's research, I began to alter how I praised him, but not completely. I suppose my hesitation was that the mind-set Dweck wants students to have—a firm belief that the way to bounce back from failure is to work harder—sounds awfully clichéd: Try, try again.",
"But it turns out that the ability to repeatedly respond to failure by exerting more effort—instead of simply giving up—is a trait well studied in psychology. People with this trait, persistence, rebound well and can sustain their motivation through long periods of delayed gratification. Delving into this research, I learned that persistence turns out to be more than a conscious act of will; it's also an unconscious response, governed by a circuit in the brain. Dr. Robert Cloninger at Washington University in St. Louis located the circuit in a part of the brain called the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex. It monitors the reward center of the brain, and like a switch, it intervenes when there's a lack of immediate reward. When it switches on, it's telling the rest of the brain, \"Don't stop trying. There's dopa [the brain's chemical reward for success] on the horizon.\" While putting people through MRI scans, Cloninger could see this switch lighting up regularly in some. In others, barely at all.",
"What makes some people wired to have an active circuit?",
"Cloninger has trained rats and mice in mazes to have persistence by carefully not rewarding them when they get to the finish. \"The key is intermittent reinforcement,\" says Cloninger. The brain has to learn that frustrating spells can be worked through. \"A person who grows up getting too frequent rewards will not have persistence, because they'll quit when the rewards disappear.\"",
"That sold me. I'd thought \"praise junkie\" was just an expression—but suddenly, it seemed as if I could be setting up my son's brain for an actual chemical need for constant reward.",
"What would it mean, to give up praising our children so often? Well, if I am one example, there are stages of withdrawal, each of them subtle. In the first stage, I fell off the wagon around other parents when they were busy praising their kids. I didn't want Luke to feel left out. I felt like a former alcoholic who continues to drink socially. I became a Social Praiser.",
"Then I tried to use the specific-type praise that Dweck recommends. I praised Luke, but I attempted to praise his \"process.\" This was easier said than done. What are the processes that go on in a 5-year-old's mind? In my impression, 80 percent of his brain processes lengthy scenarios for his action figures.",
"But every night he has math homework and is supposed to read a phonics book aloud. Each takes about five minutes if he concentrates, but he's easily distracted. So I praised him for concentrating without asking to take a break. If he listened to instructions carefully, I praised him for that. After soccer games, I praised him for looking to pass, rather than just saying, \"You played great.\" And if he worked hard to get to the ball, I praised the effort he applied.",
"Just as the research promised, this focused praise helped him see strategies he could apply the next day. It was remarkable how noticeably effective this new form of praise was.",
"Truth be told, while my son was getting along fine under the new praise regime, it was I who was suffering. It turns out that I was the real praise junkie in the family. Praising him for just a particular skill or task felt like I left other parts of him ignored and unappreciated. I recognized that praising him with the universal \"You're great—I'm proud of you\" was a way I expressed unconditional love.",
"Offering praise has become a sort of panacea for the anxieties of modern parenting. Out of our children's lives from breakfast to dinner, we turn it up a notch when we get home. In those few hours together, we want them to hear the things we can't say during the day—We are in your corner, we are here for you, we believe in you.",
"In a similar way, we put our children in high-pressure environments, seeking out the best schools we can find, then we use the constant praise to soften the intensity of those environments. We expect so much of them, but we hide our expectations behind constant glowing praise. The duplicity became glaring to me.",
"Eventually, in my final stage of praise withdrawal, I realized that not telling my son he was smart meant I was leaving it up to him to make his own conclusion about his intelligence. Jumping in with praise is like jumping in too soon with the answer to a homework problem—it robs him of the chance to make the deduction himself.",
"But what if he makes the wrong conclusion?",
"Can I really leave this up to him, at his age?",
"I'm still an anxious parent. This morning, I tested him on the way to school: \"What happens to your brain, again, when it gets to think about something hard?\"",
"\"It gets bigger, like a muscle,\" he responded, having aced this one before."

			"headline": "In print as This is Water: Some thoughts, delivered on a significant occasion, about living a compassionate life (Little, Brown 2009)",
			"contents": [
"Greetings, parents, and congratulations to Kenyon's graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says \"Morning, boys. How's the water?\" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes \"What the hell is water?\"",
"This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre…but if you're worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don't be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.",
"Of course the main requirement of speeches like this is that I'm supposed to talk about your liberal arts education's meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let's talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about \"teaching you how to think.\" If you're like me as a student, you've never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I'm going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we're supposed to get in a place like this isn't really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I'd ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket, for just a few minutes, your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.",
"Here's another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: \"Look, it's not like I don't have actual reasons for not believing in God. It's not like I haven't ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn't see a thing, and it was fifty below, and so I 2",
"tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out 'Oh, God, if there is a God, I'm lost in this blizzard, and I'm gonna die if you don't help me.'\" And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. \"Well then you must believe now,\" he says, \"After all, here you are, alive.\" The atheist just rolls his eyes. \"No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.\"",
"It's easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people's two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy's interpretation is true and the other guy's is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person's most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there's the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They're probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists' problem is exactly the same as the story's unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up.",
"The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.",
"Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe; the realist, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centeredness because it's so socially repulsive. But it's pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people's thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.",
"Please don't worry that I'm getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called \"virtues.\" This is not a matter of virtue. It's a matter of 3",
"my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being \"well-adjusted\", which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.",
"Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education -- least in my own case -- is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualize stuff, to get lost in abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.",
"As I'm sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about \"teaching you how to think\" is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: \"learning how to think\" really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed.",
"Think of the old cliché about \"the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.\" This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.",
"And I submit that this is what the real, no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let's get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what \"day in, day out\" really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine, and petty frustration. The parents and older folks here will know all too well what I'm talking about.",
"By way of example, let's say it's an average adult day, and you get up in the morning, go to your challenging, white-collar, college-graduate job, and you work hard for eight or ten hours, and at the end of the day you're tired and somewhat stressed and all you want is to go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour, and then hit the sack early because, of course, you have to get up the next day and do it all 4",
"again. But then you remember there's no food at home. You haven't had time to shop this week because of your challenging job, and so now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket. It's the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be: very bad. So getting to the store takes way longer than it should, and when you finally get there, the supermarket is very crowded, because of course it's the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try to squeeze in some grocery shopping. And the store is hideously lit and infused with soul-killing Muzak or corporate pop and it's pretty much the last place you want to be but you can't just get in and quickly out; you have to wander all over the huge, over-lit store's confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to maneuver your junky cart through all these other tired, hurried people with carts (et cetera, et cetera, cutting stuff out because this is a long ceremony) and eventually you get all your supper supplies, except now it turns out there aren't enough check-out lanes open even though it's the end-of-the-day rush. So the checkout line is incredibly long, which is stupid and infuriating. But you can't take your frustration out on the frantic lady working the register, who is overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college.",
"But anyway, you finally get to the checkout line's front, and you pay for your food, and you get told to \"Have a nice day\" in a voice that is the absolute voice of death. Then you have to take your creepy, flimsy, plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls maddeningly to the left, all the way out through the crowded, bumpy, littery parking lot, and then you have to drive all the way home through slow, heavy, SUV-intensive, rush-hour traffic, et cetera et cetera.",
"Everyone here has done this, of course. But it hasn't yet been part of you graduates' actual life routine, day after week after month after year.",
"But it will be. And many more dreary, annoying, seemingly meaningless routines besides. But that is not the point. The point is that petty, frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is gonna come in. Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think, and if I don't make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I'm gonna be pissed and miserable every time I have to shop. Because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About my hungriness and my fatigue and my desire to just get home, and it's going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is: I've worked really hard all day and I'm starved and I'm tired and I can't even get home to eat and unwide because of these stupid goddamn people.",
"Or, of course, if I'm in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting, I can spend time in the end-of-the-day traffic being disgusted about all the huge, stupid, 5",
"lane-blocking SUV's and Hummers and V-12 pickup trucks, burning their wasteful, selfish, forty-gallon tanks of gas, and I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper-stickers always seem to be on the biggest, most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest [responding here to loud applause] (this is an example of how NOT to think, though) most disgustingly selfish vehicles, driven by the ugliest, most inconsiderate and aggressive drivers. And I can think about how our children's children will despise us for wasting all the future's fuel, and probably screwing up the climate, and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are, and how modern consumer society just sucks, and so forth and so on.",
"You get the idea.",
"If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway, fine. Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn't have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It's the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I'm operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the center of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world's priorities.",
"The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it's not impossible that some of these people in SUV's have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he's in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in his way.",
"Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket's checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.",
"Again, please don't think that I'm giving you moral advice, or that I'm saying you are \"supposed to\" think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it. Because it's hard. It takes will and effort, and if you are like me, some days you won't be able to do it, or you just flat out won't want to.",
"But most days, if you're aware enough to give yourself a choice, you can choose to look differently at this fat, dead-eyed, over-made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line. Maybe she's not usually like this. Maybe she's been up three straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer. Or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department, who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific, infuriating, red-tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness. Of course, none of this is likely, but it's also not impossible. It just depends what you what to consider. If you're automatically sure that you know what 6",
"reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won't consider possibilities that aren't annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.",
"Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that's capital-T True is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it.",
"This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn't. You get to decide what to worship.",
"Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship -- be it JC or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles -- is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you.",
"On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness. Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.",
"But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings. They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing.",
"And the so-called \"real world\" will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is 7",
"most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving and displaying. The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.",
"That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the \"rat race,\" the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.",
"I know that this stuff probably doesn't sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to sound. What it is, as far as I can see, is the capital-T Truth, with a whole lot of rhetorical niceties stripped away. You are, of course, free to think of it whatever you wish. But please don't just dismiss it as just some finger-wagging Dr. Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after death.",
"The capital-T Truth is about life before death. It is about making it to 30, or maybe even 50, without wanting to shoot yourself in the head. It is about the real value of a real education, which has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over:",
"\"This is water.\"",
"\"This is water.\"",
"\"These Eskimos might be much more than they seem.\"",
"It is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Which means yet another grand cliché turns out to be true: your education really is the job of a lifetime. And it commences now.",
"I wish you way more than luck."

			"headline": "Here's the text of a speech Bill Watterson gave at Kenyon College, Gambier Ohio, to the 1990 graduating class.",
			"contents": [
"Bill Watterson",
"Kenyon College Commencement",
"May 20, 1990",
"I have a recurring dream about Kenyon. In it, I'm walking to the post office on the way to my first class at the start of the school year. Suddenly it occurs to me that I don't have my schedule memorized, and I'm not sure which classes I'm taking, or where exactly I'm supposed to be going. ",
"As I walk up the steps to the postoffice, I realize I don't have my box key, and in fact, I can't remember what my box number is. I'm certain that everyone I know has written me a letter, but I can't get them. I get more flustered and annoyed by the minute. I head back to Middle Path, racking my brains and asking myself, \"How many more years until I graduate? ...Wait, didn't I graduate already?? How old AM I?\" Then I wake up.",
"Experience is food for the brain. And four years at Kenyon is a rich meal. I suppose it should be no surprise that your brains will probably burp up Kenyon for a long time. And I think the reason I keep having the dream is because its central image is a metaphor for a good part of life: that is, not knowing where you're going or what you're doing. ",
"I graduated exactly ten years ago. That doesn't give me a great deal of experience to speak from, but I'm emboldened by the fact that I can't remember a bit of MY commencement, and I trust that in half an hour, you won't remember of yours either.",
"In the middle of my sophomore year at Kenyon, I decided to paint a copy of Michelangelo's \"Creation of Adam\" from the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of my dorm room. By standing on a chair, I could reach the ceiling, and I taped off a section, made a grid, and started to copy the picture from my art history book. ",
"Working with your arm over your head is hard work, so a few of my more ingenious friends rigged up a scaffold for me by stacking two chairs on my bed, and laying the table from the hall lounge across the chairs and over to the top of my closet. By climbing up onto my bed and up the chairs, I could hoist myself onto the table, and lie in relative comfort two feet under my painting. My roommate would then hand up my paints, and I could work for several hours at a stretch.",
"The picture took me months to do, and in fact, I didn't finish the work until very near the end of the school year. I wasn't much of a painter then, but what the work lacked in color sense and technical flourish, it gained in the incongruity of having a High Renaissance masterpiece in a college dorm that had the unmistakable odor of old beer cans and older laundry.",
"The painting lent an air of cosmic grandeur to my room, and it seemed to put life into a larger perspective. Those boring, flowery English poets didn't seem quite so important, when right above my head God was transmitting the spark of life to man.",
"My friends and I liked the finished painting so much in fact, that we decided I should ask permission to do it. As you might expect, the housing director was curious to know why I wanted to paint this elaborate picture on my ceiling a few weeks before school let out. Well, you don't get to be a sophomore at Kenyon without learning how to fabricate ideas you never had, but I guess it was obvious that my idea was being proposed retroactively. It ended up that I was allowed to paint the picture, so long as I painted over it and returned the ceiling to normal at the end of the year. And that's what I did.",
"Despite the futility of the whole episode, my fondest memories of college are times like these, where things were done out of some inexplicable inner imperative, rather than because the work was demanded. Clearly, I never spent as much time or work on any authorized art project, or any poli sci paper, as I spent on this one act of vandalism.",
"It's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for ourselves. And with all due respect to John Stuart Mill, maybe utilitarianism is overrated. If I've learned one thing from being a cartoonist, it's how important playing is to creativity and happiness. My job is essentially to come up with 365 ideas a year.",
"If you ever want to find out just how uninteresting you really are, get a job where the quality and frequency of your thoughts determine your livelihood. I've found that the only way I can keep writing every day, year after year, is to let my mind wander into new territories. To do that, I've had to cultivate a kind of mental playfulness.",
"We're not really taught how to recreate constructively. We need to do more than find diversions; we need to restore and expand ourselves. Our idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car battery-it recharges by running.",
"You may be surprised to find how quickly daily routine and the demands of \"just getting by: absorb your waking hours. You may be surprised matters of habit rather than thought and inquiry. You may be surprised to find how quickly you start to see your life in terms of other people's expectations rather than issues. You may be surprised to find out how quickly reading a good book sounds like a luxury.",
"At school, new ideas are thrust at you every day. Out in the world, you'll have to find the inner motivation to search for new ideas on your own. With any luck at all, you'll never need to take an idea and squeeze a punchline out of it, but as bright, creative people, you'll be called upon to generate ideas and solutions all your lives. Letting your mind play is the best way to solve problems.",
"For me, it's been liberating to put myself in the mind of a fictitious six year-old each day, and rediscover my own curiosity. I've been amazed at how one ideas leads to others if I allow my mind to play and wander. I know a lot about dinosaurs now, and the information has helped me out of quite a few deadlines.",
"A playful mind is inquisitive, and learning is fun. If you indulge your natural curiosity and retain a sense of fun in new experience, I think you'll find it functions as a sort of shock absorber for the bumpy road ahead.",
"So, what's it like in the real world? Well, the food is better, but beyond that, I don't recommend it.",
"I don't look back on my first few years out of school with much affection, and if I could have talked to you six months ago, I'd have encouraged you all to flunk some classes and postpone this moment as long as possible. But now it's too late.",
"Unfortunately, that was all the advice I really had. When I was sitting where you are, I was one of the lucky few who had a cushy job waiting for me. I'd drawn political cartoons for the Collegian for four years, and the Cincinnati Post had hired me as an editorial cartoonist. All my friends were either dreading the infamous first year of law school, or despondent about their chances of convincing anyone that a history degree had any real application outside of academia.",
"Boy, was I smug.",
"As it turned out, my editor instantly regretted his decision to hire me. By the end of the summer, I'd been given notice; by the beginning of winter, I was in an unemployment line; and by the end of my first year away from Kenyon, I was broke and living with my parents again. You can imagine how upset my dad was when he learned that Kenyon doesn't give refunds.",
"Watching my career explode on the lauchpad caused some soul searching. I eventually admitted that I didn't have what it takes to be a good political cartoonist, that is, an interest in politics, and I returned to my firs love, comic strips.",
"For years I got nothing but rejection letters, and I was forced to accept a real job.",
"A REAL job is a job you hate. I designed car ads and grocery ads in the windowless basement of a convenience store, and I hated every single minute of the 4-1/2 million minutes I worked there. My fellow prisoners at work were basically concerned about how to punch the time clock at the perfect second where they would earn another 20 cents without doing any work for it.",
"It was incredible: after every break, the entire staff would stand around in the garage where the time clock was, and wait for that last click. And after my used car needed the head gasket replaced twice, I waited in the garage too.",
"It's funny how at Kenyon, you take for granted that the people around you think about more than the last episode of Dynasty. I guess that's what it means to be in an ivory tower.",
"Anyway, after a few months at this job, I was starved for some life of the mind that, during my lunch break, I used to read those poli sci books that I'd somehow never quite finished when I was here. Some of those books were actually kind of interesting. It was a rude shock to see just how empty and robotic life can be when you don't care about what you're doing, and the only reason you're there is to pay the bills.",
"Thoreau said,",
"\"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"",
"That's one of those dumb cocktail quotations that will strike fear in your heart as you get older. Actually, I was leading a life of loud desperation.",
"When it seemed I would be writing about \"Midnite Madness Sale-abrations\" for the rest of my life, a friend used to console me that cream always rises to the top. I used to think, so do people who throw themselves into the sea.",
"I tell you all this because it's worth recognizing that there is no such thing as an overnight success. You will do well to cultivate the resources in yourself that bring you happiness outside of success or failure. The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive. At that time, we turn around and say, yes, this is obviously where I was going all along. It's a good idea to try to enjoy the scenery on the detours, because you'll probably take a few.",
"I still haven't drawn the strip as long as it took me to get the job. To endure five years of rejection to get a job requires either a faith in oneself that borders on delusion, or a love of the work. I loved the work.",
"Drawing comic strips for five years without pay drove home the point that the fun of cartooning wasn't in the money; it was in the work. This turned out to be an important realization when my break finally came.",
"Like many people, I found that what I was chasing wasn't what I caught. I've wanted to be a cartoonist since I was old enough to read cartoons, and I never really thought about cartoons as being a business. It never occurred to me that a comic strip I created would be at the mercy of a bloodsucking corporate parasite called a syndicate, and that I'd be faced with countless ethical decisions masquerading as simple business decisions.",
"To make a business decision, you don't need much philosophy; all you need is greed, and maybe a little knowledge of how the game works.",
"As my comic strip became popular, the pressure to capitalize on that popularity increased to the point where I was spending almost as much time screaming at executives as drawing. Cartoon merchandising is a $12 billion dollar a year industry and the syndicate understandably wanted a piece of that pie. But the more I though about what they wanted to do with my creation, the more inconsistent it seemed with the reasons I draw cartoons.",
"Selling out is usually more a matter of buying in. Sell out, and you're really buying into someone else's system of values, rules and rewards.",
"The so-called \"opportunity\" I faced would have meant giving up my individual voice for that of a money-grubbing corporation. It would have meant my purpose in writing was to sell things, not say things. My pride in craft would be sacrificed to the efficiency of mass production and the work of assistants. Authorship would become committee decision. Creativity would become work for pay. Art would turn into commerce. In short, money was supposed to supply all the meaning I'd need.",
"What the syndicate wanted to do, in other words, was turn my comic strip into everything calculated, empty and robotic that I hated about my old job. They would turn my characters into television hucksters and T-shirt sloganeers and deprive me of characters that actually expressed my own thoughts.",
"On those terms, I found the offer easy to refuse. Unfortunately, the syndicate also found my refusal easy to refuse, and we've been fighting for over three years now. Such is American business, I guess, where the desire for obscene profit mutes any discussion of conscience.",
"You will find your own ethical dilemmas in all parts of your lives, both personal and professional. We all have different desires and needs, but if we don't discover what we want from ourselves and what we stand for, we will live passively and unfulfilled. Sooner or later, we are all asked to compromise ourselves and the things we care about. We define ourselves by our actions. With each decision, we tell ourselves and the world who we are. Think about what you want out of this life, and recognize that there are many kinds of success.",
"Many of you will be going on to law school, business school, medical school, or other graduate work, and you can expect the kind of starting salary that, with luck, will allow you to pay off your own tuition debts within your own lifetime.",
"But having an enviable career is one thing, and being a happy person is another.",
"Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential-as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth.",
"You'll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you're doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you'll hear about them.",
"To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.",
"Reading those turgid philosophers here in these remote stone buildings may not get you a job, but if those books have forced you to ask yourself questions about what makes life truthful, purposeful, meaningful, and redeeming, you have the Swiss Army Knife of mental tools, and it's going to come in handy all the time.",
"I think you'll find that Kenyon touched a deep part of you. These have been formative years. Chances are, at least of your roommates has taught you everything ugly about human nature you ever wanted to know.",
"With luck, you've also had a class that transmitted a spark of insight or interest you'd never had before. Cultivate that interest, and you may find a deeper meaning in your life that feeds your soul and spirit. Your preparation for the real world is not in the answers you've learned, but in the questions you've learned how to ask yourself.",
"Graduating from Kenyon, I suspect you'll find yourselves quite well prepared indeed.",
"I wish you all fulfillment and happiness. Congratulations on your achievement."

			"contents": [
"Recently I received an e-mail that wasn't meant for me, but was about me. I'd been cc'd by accident. This is one of the darker hazards of electronic communication, Reason No. 697 Why the Internet Is Bad — the dreadful consequence of hitting \"reply all\" instead of \"reply\" or \"forward.\" The context is that I had rented a herd of goats for reasons that aren't relevant here and had sent out a mass e-mail with photographs of the goats attached to illustrate that a) I had goats, and b) it was good. Most of the responses I received expressed appropriate admiration and envy of my goats, but the message in question was intended not as a response to me but as an aside to some of the recipient's co-workers, sighing over the kinds of expenditures on which I was frittering away my uncomfortable income. The word \"oof\" was used.",
"I've often thought that the single most devastating cyberattack a diabolical and anarchic mind could design would not be on the military or financial sector but simply to simultaneously make every e-mail and text ever sent universally public. It would be like suddenly subtracting the strong nuclear force from the universe; the fabric of society would instantly evaporate, every marriage, friendship and business partnership dissolved. Civilization, which is held together by a fragile web of tactful phrasing, polite omissions and white lies, would collapse in an apocalypse of bitter recriminations and weeping, breakups and fistfights, divorces and bankruptcies, scandals and resignations, blood feuds, litigation, wholesale slaughter in the streets and lingering ill will.",
"This particular e-mail was, in itself, no big deal. Tone is notoriously easy to misinterpret over e-mail, and my friend's message could have easily been read as affectionate head shaking rather than a contemptuous eye roll. It's frankly hard to parse the word \"oof\" in this context. And let's be honest — I am terrible with money, but I've always liked to think of this as an endearing foible. What was surprisingly wounding wasn't that the e-mail was insulting but simply that it was unsympathetic. Hearing other people's uncensored opinions of you is an unpleasant reminder that you're just another person in the world, and everyone else does not always view you in the forgiving light that you hope they do, making all allowances, always on your side. There's something existentially alarming about finding out how little room we occupy, and how little allegiance we command, in other people's heads.",
"This experience is not a novelty of the information age; it's always been available to us by the accident of overhearing a conversation at the wrong moment. I've written essays about friends that I felt were generous and empathetic, which they experienced as devastating. I've also been written about, in ways I could find no fault with but that were nonetheless excruciating for me to read. It is simply not pleasant to be objectively observed — it's like seeing a candid photo of yourself online, not smiling or posing, but simply looking the way you apparently always do, oblivious and mush-faced with your mouth open. It's proof that we are visible to others, that we are seen, in all our naked silliness and stupidity.",
"Needless to say, this makes us embarrassed and angry and damn our betrayers as vicious two-faced hypocrites. Which, in fact, we all are. We all make fun of one another behind one another's backs, even the people we love. Of course we do — they're ridiculous. Anyone worth knowing is inevitably also going to be exasperating: making the same obvious mistakes over and over, dating imbeciles, endlessly relapsing into their dumb addictions and self-defeating habits, blind to their own hilarious flaws and blatant contradictions and fiercely devoted to whatever keeps them miserable. (And those few people about whom there is nothing ridiculous are by far the most preposterous of all.)",
"Just as teasing someone to his face is a way of letting him know that you know him better than he thinks, making fun of him behind his back is a way of bonding with your mutual friends, reassuring one another that you both know and love and are driven crazy by this same person.",
"Although sometimes, let's just admit, we're simply being mean. A friend of mine described the time in high school when someone walked up behind her while she was saying something clever at that person's expense as the worst feeling she had ever had — and not just because of the hurt she'd inflicted on someone else but because of what it forced her to see about herself. That she made fun of people all the time, people who didn't deserve it, who were beneath her in the social hierarchy, just to ingratiate herself or make herself seem funny or cool.",
"Another friend once shared with me one of the aphorisms of 12-step recovery programs: \"What other people think of you is none of your business.\" Like a lot of wisdom, this sounds at first suspiciously similar to idiotic nonsense; obviously what other people think of you is your business, it's your main job in life to try to control it, to do tireless P.R. and spin control for yourself. Every woman who ever went out with you must pine for you forever. Those who rejected you must regret it. You must be loved, respected — above all, taken seriously! They who mocked you will rue the day! The problem is that this is insane — the psychology of dictators who regard all dissent as treason, and periodically order purges to ensure unquestioning loyalty. It's no way to run a country.",
"THE operative fallacy here is that we believe that unconditional love means not seeing anything negative about someone, when it really means pretty much the opposite: loving someone despite their infuriating flaws and essential absurdity. \"Do I want to be loved in spite of?\" Donald Barthelme writes in his story \"Rebecca\" about a woman with green skin. \"Do you? Does anyone? But aren't we all, to some degree?\"",
"We don't give other people credit for the same interior complexity we take for granted in ourselves, the same capacity for holding contradictory feelings in balance, for complexly alloyed affections, for bottomless generosity of heart and petty, capricious malice. We can't believe that anyone could be unkind to us and still be genuinely fond of us, although we do it all the time.",
"Years ago a friend of mine had a dream about a strange invention; a staircase you could descend deep underground, in which you heard recordings of all the things anyone had ever said about you, both good and bad. The catch was, you had to pass through all the worst things people had said before you could get to the highest compliments at the very bottom. There is no way I would ever make it more than two and a half steps down such a staircase, but I understand its terrible logic: if we want the rewards of being loved we have to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known."

Needless to say, I was impressed with how far the technology had advanced in three years. Even when I didn't have anybody to call or text or e-mail, I wanted to keep fondling my new Bold and experiencing the marvelous clarity of its screen, the silky action of its track pad, the shocking speed of its responses, the beguiling elegance of its graphics.",
"I was, in short, infatuated with my new device. I'd been similarly infatuated with my old device, of course; but over the years the bloom had faded from our relationship. I'd developed trust issues with my Pearl, accountability issues, compatibility issues and even, toward the end, some doubts about my Pearl's very sanity, until I'd finally had to admit to myself that I'd outgrown the relationship.",
"Do I need to point out that — absent some wild, anthropomorphizing projection in which my old BlackBerry felt sad about the waning of my love for it — our relationship was entirely one-sided? Let me point it out anyway.",
"Let me further point out how ubiquitously the word \"sexy\" is used to describe late-model gadgets; and how the extremely cool things that we can do now with these gadgets — like impelling them to action with voice commands, or doing that spreading-the-fingers iPhone thing that makes images get bigger — would have looked, to people a hundred years ago, like a magician's incantations, a magician's hand gestures; and how, when we want to describe an erotic relationship that's working perfectly, we speak, indeed, of magic.",
"Let me toss out the idea that, as our markets discover and respond to what consumers most want, our technology has become extremely adept at creating products that correspond to our fantasy ideal of an erotic relationship, in which the beloved object asks for nothing and gives everything, instantly, and makes us feel all powerful, and doesn't throw terrible scenes when it's replaced by an even sexier object and is consigned to a drawer.",
"To speak more generally, the ultimate goal of technology, the telos of techne, is to replace a natural world that's indifferent to our wishes — a world of hurricanes and hardships and breakable hearts, a world of resistance — with a world so responsive to our wishes as to be, effectively, a mere extension of the self.",
"Let me suggest, finally, that the world of techno-consumerism is therefore troubled by real love, and that it has no choice but to trouble love in turn.",
"Its first line of defense is to commodify its enemy. You can all supply your own favorite, most nauseating examples of the commodification of love. Mine include the wedding industry, TV ads that feature cute young children or the giving of automobiles as Christmas presents, and the particularly grotesque equation of diamond jewelry with everlasting devotion. The message, in each case, is that if you love somebody you should buy stuff.",
"A related phenomenon is the transformation, courtesy of Facebook, of the verb \"to like\" from a state of mind to an action that you perform with your computer mouse, from a feeling to an assertion of consumer choice. And liking, in general, is commercial culture's substitute for loving. The striking thing about all consumer products — and none more so than electronic devices and applications — is that they're designed to be immensely likable. This is, in fact, the definition of a consumer product, in contrast to the product that is simply itself and whose makers aren't fixated on your liking it. (I'm thinking here of jet engines, laboratory equipment, serious art and literature.)",
"But if you consider this in human terms, and you imagine a person defined by a desperation to be liked, what do you see? You see a person without integrity, without a center. In more pathological cases, you see a narcissist — a person who can't tolerate the tarnishing of his or her self-image that not being liked represents, and who therefore either withdraws from human contact or goes to extreme, integrity-sacrificing lengths to be likable.",
"If you dedicate your existence to being likable, however, and if you adopt whatever cool persona is necessary to make it happen, it suggests that you've despaired of being loved for who you really are. And if you succeed in manipulating other people into liking you, it will be hard not to feel, at some level, contempt for those people, because they've fallen for your shtick. You may find yourself becoming depressed, or alcoholic, or, if you're Donald Trump, running for president (and then quitting).",
"Consumer technology products would never do anything this unattractive, because they aren't people. They are, however, great allies and enablers of narcissism. Alongside their built-in eagerness to be liked is a built-in eagerness to reflect well on us. Our lives look a lot more interesting when they're filtered through the sexy Facebook interface. We star in our own movies, we photograph ourselves incessantly, we click the mouse and a machine confirms our sense of mastery.",
"And, since our technology is really just an extension of ourselves, we don't have to have contempt for its manipulability in the way we might with actual people. It's all one big endless loop. We like the mirror and the mirror likes us. To friend a person is merely to include the person in our private hall of flattering mirrors.",
"I may be overstating the case, a little bit. Very probably, you're sick to death of hearing social media disrespected by cranky 51-year-olds. My aim here is mainly to set up a contrast between the narcissistic tendencies of technology and the problem of actual love. My friend Alice Sebold likes to talk about \"getting down in the pit and loving somebody.\" She has in mind the dirt that love inevitably splatters on the mirror of our self-regard.",
"The simple fact of the matter is that trying to be perfectly likable is incompatible with loving relationships. Sooner or later, for example, you're going to find yourself in a hideous, screaming fight, and you'll hear coming out of your mouth things that you yourself don't like at all, things that shatter your self-image as a fair, kind, cool, attractive, in-control, funny, likable person. Something realer than likability has come out in you, and suddenly you're having an actual life.",
"Suddenly there's a real choice to be made, not a fake consumer choice between a BlackBerry and an iPhone, but a question: Do I love this person? And, for the other person, does this person love me?",
"There is no such thing as a person whose real self you like every particle of. This is why a world of liking is ultimately a lie. But there is such a thing as a person whose real self you love every particle of. And this is why love is such an existential threat to the techno-consumerist order: it exposes the lie.",
"This is not to say that love is only about fighting. Love is about bottomless empathy, born out of the heart's revelation that another person is every bit as real as you are. And this is why love, as I understand it, is always specific. Trying to love all of humanity may be a worthy endeavor, but, in a funny way, it keeps the focus on the self, on the self's own moral or spiritual well-being. Whereas, to love a specific person, and to identify with his or her struggles and joys as if they were your own, you have to surrender some of your self.",
"The big risk here, of course, is rejection. We can all handle being disliked now and then, because there's such an infinitely big pool of potential likers. But to expose your whole self, not just the likable surface, and to have it rejected, can be catastrophically painful. The prospect of pain generally, the pain of loss, of breakup, of death, is what makes it so tempting to avoid love and stay safely in the world of liking.",
"And yet pain hurts but it doesn't kill. When you consider the alternative — an anesthetized dream of self-sufficiency, abetted by technology — pain emerges as the natural product and natural indicator of being alive in a resistant world. To go through a life painlessly is to have not lived. Even just to say to yourself, \"Oh, I'll get to that love and pain stuff later, maybe in my 30s\" is to consign yourself to 10 years of merely taking up space on the planet and burning up its resources. Of being (and I mean this in the most damning sense of the word) a consumer.",
"When I was in college, and for many years after, I liked the natural world. Didn't love it, but definitely liked it. It can be very pretty, nature. And since I was looking for things to find wrong with the world, I naturally gravitated to environmentalism, because there were certainly plenty of things wrong with the environment. And the more I looked at what was wrong — an exploding world population, exploding levels of resource consumption, rising global temperatures, the trashing of the oceans, the logging of our last old-growth forests — the angrier I became.",
"Finally, in the mid-1990s, I made a conscious decision to stop worrying about the environment. There was nothing meaningful that I personally could do to save the planet, and I wanted to get on with devoting myself to the things I loved. I still tried to keep my carbon footprint small, but that was as far as I could go without falling back into rage and despair.",
"BUT then a funny thing happened to me. It's a long story, but basically I fell in love with birds. I did this not without significant resistance, because it's very uncool to be a birdwatcher, because anything that betrays real passion is by definition uncool. But little by little, in spite of myself, I developed this passion, and although one-half of a passion is obsession, the other half is love.",
"And so, yes, I kept a meticulous list of the birds I'd seen, and, yes, I went to inordinate lengths to see new species. But, no less important, whenever I looked at a bird, any bird, even a pigeon or a robin, I could feel my heart overflow with love. And love, as I've been trying to say today, is where our troubles begin.",
"Because now, not merely liking nature but loving a specific and vital part of it, I had no choice but to start worrying about the environment again. The news on that front was no better than when I'd decided to quit worrying about it — was considerably worse, in fact — but now those threatened forests and wetlands and oceans weren't just pretty scenes for me to enjoy. They were the home of animals I loved.",
"And here's where a curious paradox emerged. My anger and pain and despair about the planet were only increased by my concern for wild birds, and yet, as I began to get involved in bird conservation and learned more about the many threats that birds face, it became easier, not harder, to live with my anger and despair and pain.",
"How does this happen? I think, for one thing, that my love of birds became a portal to an important, less self-centered part of myself that I'd never even known existed. Instead of continuing to drift forward through my life as a global citizen, liking and disliking and withholding my commitment for some later date, I was forced to confront a self that I had to either straight-up accept or flat-out reject.",
"Which is what love will do to a person. Because the fundamental fact about all of us is that we're alive for a while but will die before long. This fact is the real root cause of all our anger and pain and despair. And you can either run from this fact or, by way of love, you can embrace it.",
"When you stay in your room and rage or sneer or shrug your shoulders, as I did for many years, the world and its problems are impossibly daunting. But when you go out and put yourself in real relation to real people, or even just real animals, there's a very real danger that you might love some of them.",
"And who knows what might happen to you then?",

"Miuccia Prada is a fashion designer by profession, but she's also an art curator, film producer, fledgling architect, conflicted feminist, avid consumer and unreconstructed socialist. Meet the modern woman.",
"It had gone dark by the time I found the shop in Milan that belonged to Miuccia Prada's grandfather. Near the Duomo and housed in a glass and marble walkway called Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the shop is now like a beacon in some modern Italian fantasy of style and wealth. Outside, there might be industrial decline and migration, but here the lights are fantastic and the people are drawn to it like moths. In the opening scene of Visconti's classic movie \"Rocco and His Brothers,\" the Parondis come from the south to seek a new life in Milan. They look out from the tram as it goes through the dark city and all they can see is shops. \"Rocco,\" says one of the brothers to Alain Delon, \"look at those shops and the lights. It's like daylight.\"",
"Mario Prada made leather goods. In 1918 his collection included a lizard bag with marcasite and a buckle of lapis lazuli. The highlight of 1927 was a wallet in toad skin and silver. When he died, his daughter took over, and eventually she brought in her youngest daughter, the smiling Miuccia, who was known to the family as Miu Miu. In 1978, she designed a black nylon rucksack that would later take the world by storm. With her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, she transformed the company from being a much-admired, eccentric retailer of luxury goods into a contemporary design powerhouse with sales of over $5 billion. The famous Prada brand, which includes women's wear and men's wear, is much copied — \"The job is to do something interesting with ideas,\" Miuccia told me, \"and if it is copied I couldn't care less\" — and the group includes other brands like Miu Miu and the English shoe company Church's.",
"Mrs. Prada, as she is known, who stands at about 5 foot 4 inches, usually gives little away, but when I met her I found her just about ready to open out of her enigma. Some designers are seekers of trends, but Prada actually is the trend, season after season, leaving others spinning at her heels as she unfolds her singular vision of what a woman can be. People keep saying: \"How does she do it?\" And the secret may lie in how she connects to the spirit of the age: she is a curious capitalist philosopher with a brilliant instinct for modern desire. She is a designer not afraid to reach into what makes people human, asking odd questions, then coming back with very elegant answers.",
"\"Fashion is about the way we compose ourselves every day,\" Mrs. Prada once wrote. This was on my mind when I met her at her headquarters in the Via Bergamo. The rain was coming down heavily when Prada arrived in a dark blue Audi and quickly dashed into one of the gray buildings. She was charming from the moment we sat down, and filled, you might say, with the easy laughter of strong conviction, the mirth of certainty. And yet Prada is pleased to live within her contradictions. It may be the thing that makes her able to create menacing, interesting work: in her core she is equally unafraid of failure and success.",
"\"When I started, fashion was the worst place to be if you were a leftist feminist. It was horrid. I had a prejudice, yes, I always had a problem with it,\" she said. \"I suppose I felt guilty not to be doing something more important, more political. So in a way I am trying to use the company for these other activities.\" She later added, \"I'm not interested in the silhouette and I'm not able to draw. It's complicated.",
"I am trying to work out which images of the female I want to analyze. I'm not really interested in clothes or style.\"",
"We talked about how her sense of style might become an instrument of even greater change. Why, for instance, do women behave as if age is a prison? Isn't our era's obsession with youth a form of mass hysteria? \"It is much more of a drama for women, the business of aging. No one wants to age, and I really think we should find a solution. Especially because we live so much longer,\" she said. \"It used to be that a woman would have only one life, one husband, and if you were bored that was that. Now, you can have two or three lives. So even the concept of family is changing. I think this question of aging will define the society of the future.\"",
"\"So why not use older models sometimes?\" I asked.",
"\"Mine is not an artistic world, it is a commercial world. I cannot change the rules.\"",
"\"But you change the rules,\" I said. \"If you put an old lady on the runway, other people would do it too.\"",
"She laughed. In that light her eyes were green; before I asked the question they were brown. \"Let's say I'm not brave enough. I don't have the courage.\"",
"Yet courage is what she does have. When you take on the fashion world and ask it to reconsider the meaning of beauty, that's courage. She is not, as insurance men say, risk-averse. I asked her what is the power of ugly?",
"\"This is a question close to the meaning of my job. Ugly is attractive, ugly is exciting. Maybe because it is newer,\" she said. \"The investigation of ugliness is, to me, more interesting than the bourgeois idea of beauty. And why? Because ugly is human. It touches the bad and the dirty side of people. You know, this might have been a scandal in fashion but in other fields of art it is common: in painting and in movies, it was so common to see ugliness. But, yes, it was not used in fashion and I was very much criticized for inventing the trashy and the ugly. \"",
"\"The novelist Flaubert hated the rituals of bourgeois life. You do, also, don't you?\"",
"\"For sure. And we have to define what these rituals are.\"",
"\"Good taste.\"",
"\"Ah, for sure,\" she said. \"By definition good taste is horrible taste. I do have a healthy disrespect for those values. I don't want to sound like a snob, but it comes very easy to me. I have to say that, although I rejected those values for a lot of my life, it was not for very noble reasons. Let's just say that. I have to be honest. I don't feel it was very good or very noble to feel more cultured or superior.\"",
"Prada pleases herself, and she does it with dedication. She makes what she wants to make, which may be why other designers are not only touched by her aesthetic but appear to have graduated from her school of thinking. \"Prada's designs stem from an inner vision of herself,\" said the New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn, \"and plainly it's filled with images from Italian films and conflicts involving beauty. But the upshot is a tangled, what-a-woman sexiness.\"",
"Yet there may be an essence in Prada's work that says no to self-satisfaction. It doesn't say: \"You're lovely. You deserve this. You're worth it.\" It says something more like, \"Who are you? Dare to find out. And dare to be otherwise.\" This essence has a broad tendency to inflect the moment we are living through. A generation has come about that believes in the virtues of self-invention. I put it to her that she is one of the people who gives lessons in this.",
"\"I had never discovered the real reason for my job, and probably what you are saying is very true,\" she said, \"that you can choose your life. You can change your mind and change your clothes. We have to talk more because maybe now I know one of the reasons why I do my job.\"",
"\"I am a novelist,\" I said. \"I invent people for a living. But so do you.\"",
"\"You are right. I always thought it was an escape, and 'to dream' was something I didn't like. But this is very true and very good also, that you can use the clothes to reinvent yourself. The first thing a poor person has is her body. People talk about luxury — and fashion is more or less expensive — but it is nevertheless democratic.\"",
"\"One of the cheaper ways of changing yourself.\"",
"\"It is one of the first levels of emancipation.\"",
"She relaxed as the hours passed. When we began talking, she kept making as if to take off her coat and then she would put it back on again, not sure if she felt comfortable. I chose to see this as part of her nature: not getting too comfortable. Yet you can see how enlarged she becomes, comfortable or not, with ideas and with the invitation to search her feelings. For someone so dedicated to change, every day another change, this 64-year-old woman loves the idea of being delighted. From her third-floor office she has a slide that winds down to the ground floor, an artwork by Carsten Höller, that allows at least one burst of delight whenever you feel like it. She doesn't collaborate with artists in her designs — like the slide, they are a fascinating diversion from it — but her art foundation, supporting and exhibiting art, film and architecture, has made her another kind of impresario, a person who gauges the culture's stories and stimulates investigation. She has supported a clutch of filmmakers, like Roman Polanski and Wes Anderson, through short films for various Prada ventures and her friends say she is poised to enter the world of feature films in a meaningful way. A wide range of artists, including Francesco Vezzoli, Cindy Sherman, Baz Luhrmann and the architects Rem Koolhaas and Herzog & de Meuron, feel connected to her vision of personal transformation. \"I once asked Louise Bourgeois why people were so interested in fashion,\" Prada told me, \"and she said, 'In the end, people want to seduce.' But I don't think this is enough. I believe it is more complicated.\"",
"The complication is that the people the Prada consumers often want to seduce are themselves. We want to test who we can be in an atmosphere not bloated with obvious effort. Prada's clothes make you feel you are appearing at your most calm and your least demonstrative, which is a kind of freedom for people who yearn to look good but don't want the yearning to show.",
"Prada trained as a mime, and she performed at La Scala and other places when she was young. She was a communist who believed, like many of her 1960s generation, that change would come not through commodities but through revolution. Well, there was a revolution, but it was, as those who remember the hours after the Berlin Wall came down, a revolution of blue jeans. People in East Berlin were desperate to get to the shops. Prada is one of the brands that came to life around the same time. But Miuccia floats between knowing the truth of this and wanting to discover other truths that might contradict it. \"When you create something that is 'out there,' \" I asked her, \"like kitchen utensils hanging on a skirt, do you tend to know in advance that this might not be commercial?\"",
"\"Yes. But I have to do it. There is an understanding that, when I do a show, no one will tell me what to do. Once, at the beginning of my career, I tried to listen to others and it was all wrong. I have to do what I think is right, and now everybody is happy that it is like this. We might later decide to do something more wearable that is based on the original ideas, but, you know, some collections are easier than others.\"",
"\"Can too much democracy hurt fashion? It used to be so elitist and that's what people liked about it.\"",
"\"It's like when too many people go to a museum, does it destroy the level of the museum? I choose a wider audience. I also think when I'm doing the shows I try to be more obvious, more loud, more clear.\"",
"\"Why?\"",
"\"Because I think if you don't scream, no one listens. If you are too delicate, too subtle, your voice gets diluted. But you don't have to give up the sophistication. The last two days when I'm doing a show, the work is, for me, complicated, but then in the final moments I think, 'What is the title of this show?' And then I try to make it more clear, so that it appeals to people who maybe know less about fashion as well as appealing to people that are fixated with it. There are different levels of understanding. You have to touch people. It's probably like a song: you have to touch something deep. I'm now trying to open myself much more. In the '90s, I was considered minimal and this was because I was hiding myself and my ideas.\"",
"\"You were nervous of criticism?\"",
"\"Yes. But now I give more of myself. You have to go deeper,\" she said. \"At the beginning, I didn't want to give up myself and that was a big problem. A bag is exterior to you, but with clothes you are getting nearer. I knew I would have to give more.\"",
"There is something industrial about Prada's headquarters, something that chimes with the outlying areas of Milan, the housing projects and factories shot by Visconti, whose films have long been a reference point for the designer. It is all of a piece with the clothes actually, marrying form and function, the ugly and the beautiful, to make something that redefines the meaning of glamour. Some designers simply put a shine on desire and then issue the appropriate sunglasses, but Prada is busy finding a whole new way of thinking. You'll pay for it, certainly, but you won't pay for it by cashing in your powers of thinking because that's what she does, consistently imbuing her designs with a personal mindfulness.",
"\"Would you say selling is as important as making?\"",
"\"Yes. If people take money out of their pockets, it means that what you are doing is relevant to them. I hope they don't just buy because there is a logo but because the object is relevant to them. To sell is to prove that what you are doing makes sense. I'm completely against the idea that we do fashion for an elite — that would be too easy, in a way.\"",
"I believe there is a small anxiety in Prada. She worries, perhaps, as a feminist, as a thinker, as a person who loves art and culture — with a Ph.D. in political science from Milan University — that the fashion world might be bent on trivializing the world's problems. She might also worry that a rich fashion designer is disqualified from addressing such problems or talking about ordinary life. But in fact she has pushed consistently for fashion to address some of the more searching aspects of the times. Fashion follows her, and artists love her, because she is properly responsive to change. Most iconoclasts become bigots for their own program: not her. She is ready at all times to be proved wrong.",
"'How important is it for people to love themselves? I mean women.\"",
"Her smile grew. She called for Champagne. \"Now that you ask me, I ask myself,\" she said. \"What do you think?\"",
"\"I think it's overrated.\"",
"\"Bravo!\" she said. \"This is great. This is something I can tell my friends. What a liberation. You can hate yourself!\"",
"She asked me to give her the card with my question on it. She wanted to save it for later. A tray of the world's most delicate sandwiches arrived, cucumber squares and triangles with small curls of anchovy set at the corner. Prada's beautiful, beaten, brown Miu Miu leather coat was now off her shoulders; she was wearing a light brown jumper underneath. She wore a silk, off-white skirt and a pair of burgundy-colored sandals encrusted with fake jewels. Everything she had on her body was invented by her. I told her that if I was in her shoes I'd sometimes be desperate to get away from the brand.",
"\"I'm never in the brand,\" she said.",
"\"That's not where you live?\"",
"\"No. I want Prada to be successful. But the idea of the brand doesn't interest me, and I never think about it.\"",
"\"Is your work a self-portrait?\"",
"\"Yes.\"",
"\"What makes you so sure?\"",
"\"It comes from me. It's my soul. It's my life. My work and my life are more or less the same thing, and I never consider that the work is something different,\" she said. The job, the foundation, my personal life, it's all one thing.\" You can believe that when you see how her big stores, or \"epicenters,\" have become not just marketplaces but zones of concentric culture, where a film might be shown and the shop — often built by Rem Koolhaas — might revolve and you might attend a gig by the Hours. This is the position she has created, where a great modern designer can be a mogul, a curator, a lightning rod and a fan. Imagine Andy Warhol at his height with 461 stores operating in 70 countries. And to think that Prada's grandfather didn't want the women in the family to be involved in running the business.",
"One of her friends told me she liked Elizabeth Taylor, and I thought of the late film star when I saw Prada's sandals. Prada admits to a trashier side, and she lit up when I said I wanted to talk to her about Elizabeth Taylor's diamonds. \"Is it O.K. that she got them from men?\"",
"\"Yes,\" she said. \"Sometimes I still feel that women don't appreciate their position in society. That we are not strong enough to impose our thinking. We don't like businesswomen: we go against women who appear to be like men. And I always wanted to have aspects of character from everywhere, and not only be one way. I had friends who said, 'No men, no children, total independence.' I chose a compromise, a complete compromise. I chose a bit of avant-garde, a bit of fashion, and for me it works. I don't want to reject my past because I have it so deeply inside myself. To be nice with a man, I don't think it's so bad.\" (She is also the mother of two sons in their 20s.)",
"Prada was the natural choice to dress the girls in Baz Luhrmann's movie \"The Great Gatsby.\" In a contemporary way, she understands the conjunction of money and romance and dreams, American or otherwise. She didn't need a commission: the style of the film could have taken itself from the Fitzgeraldian contradictions and investigations into selfhood that have for years been the hallmark of her work. By the time Prada met Luhrmann and the film's star, Carey Mulligan, to discuss a possible collaboration, they had already tested some of her clothes on screen.",
"\"You like diamonds?\"",
"\"I'm interested in jewels,\" she said. \"I know what it is: I only like antique jewelry because I like the stories attached to them. I like to know who was wearing them. It's the life of people that interests me. Also, they are beautiful. Flowers and jewels are part of a woman's history. I like to look at these jewels and wonder if the woman was happy. For instance, I have a brooch which features a boat in the sea and on top there is a little gold rose and over this a spider. And I wonder who gave it to the woman? Was she a lucky woman? What does it mean?\"",
"She'll go on thinking. People will go on buying. And one day we might wake up and find that our everyday reality was actually made by shy and pivotal little geniuses like Miuccia Prada, half-capitalist, half-communist, searching for the next big idea and often finding it very close to home. When I left her, she was still waving the little notecard with the question on it about whether a woman must love herself in order to be happy. As her car sped away under the low, gray Prada sky, I guessed that her answer might be that loving oneself is irrelevant. What's important is to know yourself. \"If it's fake, it doesn't work,\" she had said. \"It has to be true to yourself first and then it might be successful.\""

"Let's say that he should go out and hang himself because he finds that writing well is impossibly difficult. Then he should be cut down without mercy and forced by his own self to write as well as he can for the rest of his life. At least he will have the story of the hanging to commence with.",
"Writing is a mentally difficult thing — it's hard to know when something's worth saying; it's hard to be clear; it's hard to arrange things in a way that will hold a reader's attention; it's hard to sound good; it's even hard to know whether, when you change something, you're making it better. It's all so hard that it's actually painful, the way a long run is painful. It's a pain you dread but somehow enjoy.",
"I worked on my Hofstadter piece until early Thursday afternoon. On Thursday night I got an unexpected email. It was a job offer, and these were the terms: $120,000 in salary, a $10,000 signing bonus, stock options, a free gym membership, excellent health and dental benefits, a new cellphone, and free lunch and dinner every weekday. My working day would start at about 11am. It would end whenever I liked, sometime in the early evening. The work would rarely strain me. I'd have a lot of autonomy and responsibility. My co-workers would be about my age, smart, and fun.",
"I put my adventure on hold.",
"In college I sort of aimlessly played. I read what I wanted and tinkered with my computer, I made little websites for my own amusement, I slept late and skipped class, and though sometimes I saw myself as an intellectual-at-large in the style of Will Hunting, I was basically just irresponsible. It's only because of an exogenous miracle that, when I graduated in 2009 with a 2.9 GPA and entered a famously bad job market, I didn't end up in privileged limbo — in Brooklyn, say, on my parents' dime. In fact, I was among the most employable young men in the world.",
"The exogenous miracle is that playing around with websites suddenly became a lucrative profession.",
"'What about somebody in a coal mine — wouldn't you say he works as hard as you? Why should you get paid so much more than that guy?'",
"I am a web developer, and there has never been a better time to do what I do. Here's how crazy it is: I have a friend who decided, part way into his second year of law school, to start coding. Two months later he was enrolled in Hacker School in New York, and three months later he was working as an intern at a consultancy that helps build websites for start-ups. A month into that internship — we're talking a total of six months here — he was promoted to a full-time position worth $85,000.",
"I didn't think finding good work would be this easy. I always figured I would end up like my sister. My sister set academic records in high school and studied at the University of Chicago but the only position matching her qualifications, when she came out of school, was a job translating airline menus. She had an especially bright and sensitive mind, but no technical specialty; and the market did what it's wont to do to people like that.",
"I remember one time at dinner she had asked my dad, who was something of a corporate bigshot: 'You always talk about the value of hard work. But what about somebody in a coal mine — wouldn't you say he works as hard as you? Why should you get paid so much more than that guy?'",
"I used to think that was an awfully naive question.",
"In 1999 a dotcom with no revenue could burn $100 million in one year, with $2 million of that going to a Super Bowl ad. Its namesake website could offer a terrible user experience, and still the company could go public. Investors would chase the rising stock price, which would drive up the price further, which in turn drew more investors, feeding a textbook 'speculative bubble' that burst the moment everyone realised there wasn't any there there.",
"This kind of stuff isn't happening any more. It's not that the internet has become less important, or investors less 'irrationally exuberant' — it's that start-ups have gotten cheaper. A web start-up today has almost no fixed capital costs. There's no need to invest in broadband infrastructure, since it's already there. There's no need to buy TV ads to get market share, when you can grow organically via search (Google) and social networks (Facebook). 'Cloud' web servers, like nearly all other services a virtual company might need — such as credit-card processing, automated telephone support, mass email delivery — can be paid for on demand, at prices pegged to Moore's Law.",
"You can see why I'm in such good shape. In this particular gold rush the shovel is me",
"Which means that these days the cost of finding out whether a start-up is actually going to succeed isn't hundreds of millions of dollars — it's hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's the cost of a couple of laptops and the salary you pay the founders while they try stuff. A $100 million pool of venture capital, instead of seeding five or 10 start-ups, can now seed 1,000 small experiments, most of which will fail, one of which will become worth a billion dollars.",
"And so there is a frenzy on.",
"You can see why I'm in such good shape. In this particular gold rush the shovel is me. We web developers are the limiting reagent of every start-up experiment, we're the sine qua non, because we're the only ones who know how to reify app ideas as actual working software. In fact, we are so much the essence of these small companies that, in Silicon Valley, a start-up with no revenue is said to be worth exactly the number of developers it has on staff. The rule of thumb is that each one counts for $1 million.",
"It helps that there aren't enough of us to go around. I'm told by a friend at Bloomberg that they missed their quarterly tech hiring target in New York by 200 people. I get at least two enquiries a week from headhunters trying to lure me from my current job. If I say that I'm actively looking, I become a kind of local celebrity, my calendar fills with coffees and conversations, reverse-interviews where start-ups try to woo me.",
"It's as if the basic structure of this sector of the global economy has been designed for my benefit. Since developers are a start-up's most important — if not their only — asset, start-ups compete by trying to be a better place for developers to work. Just a few weeks ago, an MTV2 camera crew came into my office to film an episode of a show called Jobs That Don't Suck. Cash bonuses, raises, stock options and gifts are the norm. I once worked at a place that had a special email address where you'd send requests for free stuff — a $300 keyboard, a $900 chair, organic maple syrup. I have yet to take a job where there wasn't beer readily at hand. Hours are flexible and time off is plentiful. Fuck-ups are quickly forgiven. Your concerns are given due regard. Your mind is prized. You are, in short, taken care of.",
"You can imagine what it does to the ego, to be courted and called 'indispensable' and in general treated like you're the one pretty girl for miles. When a lot of your contemporaries don't even have jobs. When work, for most people, has a Damoclean instability to it, a mortal urgency. To be this highly employable is to feel liquid, easy, as if you can do no wrong. I know that I have a great job guaranteed in any major city. And it's hard not to give a thing like that moral heft. It validates you is what I mean; it inflates your sense of your own character. I tell myself a story, sometimes, that while other people partied or read for pleasure, I was sitting in a room with my head down, fighting — that I worked hard to learn these minute technical things, and now I'm getting paid for it.",
"Something prima donna-ish can happen when you start believing stories like that. I look at a lot of inbound résumés at my current job, and I throw away everybody who's not a programmer. I do this enough times each day that a simple association has formed in my mind: if you're not technical, you're not valuable.",
"We're the ones with the magic powers. Every programmer knows that code looks cool, that eyes widen when we fill our screens with colourful incantations. 'The programmer,' the late Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra wrote in 1988, 'has to be able to think in terms of conceptual hierarchies that are much deeper than a single mind ever needed to face before.' We like that idea. We like to think that because we can code, we have unprecedented leverage over the world. We decide what 15 million people will see when they follow a link. Our laptops literally get hot from the electric action we command.",
"Nobody tells us we're wrong for thinking this way. In fact, they reinforce the impulse. They congratulate us on being ahead of the curve.",
"And when you consider my prospects without code and you consider my prospects with code, the lesson really does seem to be: join me! Try Codecademy in New York, go to Hacker School — pledge yourself, like Michael Bloomberg did in 2012, to learn to code.",
"But that shouldn't be the lesson.",
"I was only 21 when I became the chief technical officer of an American corporation. When that happened, I thought of my dad because he, too, had once been among the country's youngest corporate executives, a chief financial officer (CFO) by the time he was 28. The only difference is that the company he helped to run in his twenties was Hardee's, a fast-food restaurant chain with more than 1,000 locations, while the company I helped to run was a web start-up. Just about all we did, in our three years of operation, was spend $350,000 of other people's money. Dad's company made hamburgers; mine ate them.",
"I have a friend who's a mechanical engineer. He used to build airplane engines for General Electric, and now he's trying to develop a smarter pill bottle to improve compliance for AIDS and cancer patients. He works out of a start-up 'incubator', in an office space shared with dozens of web companies. He doesn't have a lot of patience for them. 'I'm fucking sick of it,' he told me, 'all they talk about is colours.'",
"Web start-up companies are like play-companies. They stand in relation to real companies the way those cute little make-believe baking stations stand in relation to kitchens.",
"Take Doormates, a failed start-up founded in 2011 by two recent graduates from Columbia University whose mission was to allow users 'to join or create private networks for buildings with access restricted to only building residents'. For that they, too, raised $350,000. You wonder whether anyone asked: 'Do strangers living in the same building actually want to commune? Might this problem not be better solved by a plate of sandwiches?' (The founders have since moved on to 'Mommy Nearest', an iPhone app that points out mom-friendly locations around New York.)",
"A lot of the stuff going on just isn't very ambitious. 'The thing about the advertising model is that it gets people thinking small, lean,' wrote Alexis Madrigal in an essay about start-ups in The Atlantic last year. 'Get four college kids in a room, fuel them with pizza, and see what thing they can crank out that their friends might like. Yay! Great! But you know what? They keep tossing out products that look pretty much like what you'd get if you took a homogenous group of young guys in any other endeavour: Cheap, fun, and about as worldchanging as creating a new variation on beer pong.'",
"Groupon clones are popular, as are apps that help you find nearby bars and restaurants. There are dozens of dating apps with little twists — like Tinder, an iPhone app where you swipe to the right on a potential match's picture if you like them, and to the left if you don't; or Coffee Meets Bagel, which gives you one match per day for a low-stakes, let's-just-grab-a-coffee date. SideTour, whose tech team is run by a former co-worker, lets you buy small 'experiences' around the city, like dinner with a monk. Just yesterday a developer friend of mine who'd recently gone out on his own shared his latest idea: an app that shows you nearby ATMs.",
"The most successful start-ups, at least if you go by the numbers — $13.5 million to Snapchat, $30 million to Vine, $1 billion to Instagram (each of these windfalls indirectly underwriting 100 low-rent copycats) — seem to be the ones that offer teenagers new ways to share photos with each other.",
"When I go to the supermarket I sometimes think of how much infrastructure and ingenuity has gone into converting the problem of finding my own food in the wild to the problem of walking around a room with a basket. So much intelligence and sweat has gone into getting this stuff into my hands. It's my sustenance: other people's work literally sustains me. And what do I do in return?",
"We call ourselves web developers, software engineers, builders, entrepreneurs, innovators. We're celebrated, we capture a lot of wealth and attention and talent. We've become a vortex on a par with Wall Street for precocious college grads. But we're not making the self-driving car. We're not making a smarter pill bottle. Most of what we're doing, in fact, is putting boxes on a page. Users put words and pictures into one box; we store that stuff in a database; and then out it comes into another box.",
"Web development is more like plumbing than any of us, perched in front of two slick monitors, would care to admit",
"We fill our days with the humdrum upkeep of these boxes: we change the colours; we add a link to let you edit some text; we track how far you scroll down the page; we allow you to log in with your Twitter account; we improve search results; we fix a bug where uploading a picture would sometimes never finish.",
"I do most of that work with a tool called Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails does for web developers what a toilet-installing robot would do for plumbers. (Web development is more like plumbing than any of us, perched in front of two slick monitors, would care to admit.) It makes tasks that used to take months take hours. And the important thing to understand is that I am merely a user of this thing. I didn't make it. I just read the instruction manual. In fact, I'm especially coveted in the job market because I read the instruction manual particularly carefully. Because I'm assiduous and patient with instruction manuals in general. But that's all there is to it.",
"My friends and I who are building websites — we're kids! We're kids playing around with tools given to us by adults. In decreasing order of adultness, and leaving out an awful lot, I'm talking about things such as: the Von Neumann stored program computing architecture; the transistor; high-throughput fibre-optic cables; the Unix operating system; the sci-fi-ish cloud computing platform; the web browser; the iPhone; the open source movement; Ruby on Rails; the Stack Overflow Q&A site for programmers; on and on, all the way down to the code that my slightly-more-adult co-workers write for my benefit.",
"This cascade of invention is a miracle. But as much as I want to thank the folks who did it all, I also want to warn them: When you make it this easy to write and distribute software, so easy that I can do it, you risk creating a fearsome babel of gimcrack entrepreneurship.",
"Is there another dotcom bubble on? It's hard to call it a 'bubble' when the Nasdaq's not running wild, when no one's going to lose their pension — when all anyone's going to lose is, in fact, time: time pretending at enterprise; time 'sharing' and 'liking' in forums of no consequence; time tapping out pedestrian code, extracting easy money.",
"The only rigorous way to think about value is in terms of dollars, in terms of prices arrived at by free exchange. Numbers like that are hard to dispute. If a price is 'too low' or 'too high', there's said to be an opportunity for risk-free moneymaking. People tend to gobble up those opportunities. And so the prices of things tend to level out to just where they're supposed to be, to just what the market will bear.",
"Am I paid too much to code? Am I paid too little to write? No: in each case, I'm paid exactly what I should be.",
"It's like that question my sister asked dad at dinner. There's an answer to that question — and this is the one I remember hearing that night — that says that my dad was probably paid more than the coal miner because the skills required to be CFO of a Fortune 500 company are scarcer, and more wanted, than the skills required to be a coal miner. It's the combination of scarcity and wantedness that drives up a salary.",
"And that answer seems fair, and fine, it seems to settle the question, but we're not talking about pork belly futures, we're talking about real people and what they do all day, and my sister, naive as she sounded, had a point, and that point is that the truly naive thing, the glib and facile thing, might be equating value with a market-clearing price.",
"The price of a word is being bid to zero. That one magazine story I've been working on has been in production for a year and a half now, it's been a huge part of my life, it's soaked up so many after-hours, I've done complete rewrites for editors — I've done, and will continue to do, just about anything they say — and all for free. There's no venture capital out there for this; there are no recruiters pursuing me; in writer-town I'm an absolute nothing, the average response time on the emails I send is, like, three and a half weeks. I could put the whole of my energy and talent into an article, everything I think and am, and still it could be worth zero dollars.",
"And so despite my esteem for the high challenge of writing, for the reach of the writerly life, it's not something anyone actually wants me to do. The American mind has made that very clear, it has said: 'Be a specialised something — fill your head with the zeitgeist, with the technical — and we'll write your ticket.'",
"I don't have the courage to say no to that. I have failed so far to escape the sweep of this cheap and parochial thing, and it's because I'm afraid. I am an awfully mediocre programmer — but, still, I have a secure future. More than that, I have a place at the table. In the mornings I wake up knowing that I make something people want. I know this because of all the money they give me.",
"Correction, June 9, 2013: An earlier version of this essay misstated the terms of the job offer extended to the author in October, 2012. In the previous version, the author stated that he was offered a salary of $150,000. This has been changed to reflect that the offer was for $120,000."

			"headline": "Dylan Matthews had a fascinating piece about a young man named Jason Trigg in The Washington Post on Sunday.",
			"contents": [
"Dylan Matthews had a fascinating piece about a young man named Jason Trigg in The Washington Post on Sunday. Trigg is a 25-year-old computer science graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has hit upon what he thinks is the way he can do maximum good for the world. He goes to work each day at a high-frequency trading hedge fund. But, instead of spending his ample salary, he lives the life of a graduate student and gives a large chunk of his money away.",
"Trigg has seized upon the statistic that a $2,500 donation can prevent one death from malaria, and he figures that, over the course of a lucrative Wall Street career, he can save many lives. He was motivated to think this way by the utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer.",
"From the article, Trigg seems like an earnest, morally serious man, who, if he lives out his plan, could indeed help save many lives. But if you are thinking of following his example, I would really urge caution.",
"First, you might start down this course seeing finance as a convenient means to realize your deepest commitment: fighting malaria. But the brain is a malleable organ. Every time you do an activity, or have a thought, you are changing a piece of yourself into something slightly different than it was before. Every hour you spend with others, you become more like the people around you.",
"Gradually, you become a different person. If there is a large gap between your daily conduct and your core commitment, you will become more like your daily activities and less attached to your original commitment. You will become more hedge fund, less malaria. There's nothing wrong with working at a hedge fund, but it's not the priority you started out with.",
"Second, I would be wary of inverting the natural order of affections. If you see the world on a strictly intellectual level, then a child in Pakistan or Zambia is just as valuable as your own child. But not many people actually think this way. Not many people value abstract life perceived as a statistic as much as the actual child being fed, hugged, nurtured and played with.",
"If you choose a profession that doesn't arouse your everyday passion for the sake of serving instead some abstract faraway good, you might end up as a person who values the far over the near. You might become one of those people who loves humanity in general but not the particular humans immediately around. You might end up enlarging the faculties we use to perceive the far — rationality — and eclipsing the faculties we use to interact with those closest around — affection, the capacity for vulnerability and dependence. Instead of seeing yourself as one person deeply embedded in a particular community, you may end up coolly looking across humanity as a detached god.",
"Third, and most important, I would worry about turning yourself into a means rather than an end. If you go to Wall Street mostly to make money for charity, you may turn yourself into a machine for the redistribution of wealth. You may turn yourself into a fiscal policy.",
"But a human life is not just a means to produce outcomes, it is an end in itself. When we evaluate our friends, we don't just measure the consequences of their lives. We measure who they intrinsically are. We don't merely want to know if they have done good. We want to know if they are good.",
"That's why when most people pick a vocation, they don't only want one that will be externally useful. They want one that they will enjoy, and that will make them a better person. They want to find that place, as the novelist Frederick Buechner put it, \"where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet.\"",
"If you are smart, hard-working, careful and lucky you might even be able to find a job that is both productive and internally ennobling. Taking a job just to make money, on the other hand, is probably going to be corrosive, even if you use the money for charity rather than sports cars.",
"We live in a relentlessly commercial culture, so it's natural that many people would organize their lives in utilitarian and consequentialist terms. But it's possible to get carried away with this kind of thinking — to have logic but no wisdom, to become a specialist without spirit.",
"Making yourself is different than producing a product or an external outcome, requiring different logic and different means. I'd think you would be more likely to cultivate a deep soul if you put yourself in the middle of the things that engaged you most seriously. If your profoundest interest is dying children in Africa or Bangladesh, it's probably best to go to Africa or Bangladesh, not to Wall Street."

"He will tell all of his friends that you are breathtaking. And when they smile politely he'll repeat it, slowly, No, I mean really, truly breeaaatthhhtakkkiinnngg, will insist that they think about what it would feel like to have the very wind sucked out of them and placed inside of a music box. They won't understand, but it will be the best way he will know how to describe why when you looked at him for the first time, all he could hear was music and the sound of his own breathing.",
"You will meet him at a pie-eating contest or at a bad house party or because you happen to be the only two people who like going to the park when it rains. He will be friendly and ask you for your name. You will give it to him. You will talk for hours and when he finally asks for your telephone number, you'll hesitate. Take the chance, give him your number, ask him out to coffee. He will say yes to anything you ask of him because he loves like you love: sometimes too eagerly, sometimes too early, but always deeply.",
"He won't be the most handsome or the most successful person you've ever met. His left front tooth will be a little crooked and his favorite movie will be something embarrassing like Must Love Dogs or The Lakehouse, but he'll fill your days with small surprises, like stuffing all of the pockets of all of your pants and coats with your favorite candy on your birthday. He'll write things like Have a beautiful smile and Be loved on all of your to-do lists, checking them off in thick red ink. When he walks into your living room to find you dancing, half-naked, to I want it that way he will not laugh or mock you, but will grab your hand and sing every word at the top of his lungs. And when you accidently knock over a drink at an important dinner, he'll knock over his entire plate to save you from embarrassment.",
"You will shimmy your way through many decades together. You will choose the paint for the walls of your home based on the silliness of their names: tantalizing tangerine, indigo dream. You will name your children after your favorite characters from your favorite books and he will teach them important things like the difference between frogs and toads and how to whistle with their index and pinky fingers. It won't always be an easy life, but it will be a life of dancing on tabletops and too-strong margaritas, of embarrassing-the-kid kisses and quiet afternoons with no words, no sounds other than the crinkle of pages he will turn in the book you're both reading while nesting on the couch.",
"For him, you will be the light at the end of the tunnel, the halo of glowing yellow that he has been waiting for. Never forget that you are someone worth steering for, someone worth the swift kick in the opposite direction worth all of the trials and checklists and almostrights because you are a mountaintop, the crush of violet on skin from a rainbow that seems so close to the earth that it must be real. When he comes to you, gorge on his compassion. Fill yourself completely. He will think you a miracle, a revelation and will count himself as the lucky one. Do not question him or yourself — this is exactly the kind of love you deserve."

"Pejman Nozad is one of Silicon Valleys greatest connectors. Top investors take his calls. Hitmaking entrepreneurs consider him an uncle. And somewhere in between hes piling up small stakes in some of the hottest startups in the world. Yet Nozad doesnt have the staple calling card of Silicon Valley. No M.B.A. No Ph.D. No technical background whatsoever (his words). Hes never even worked at a technology company. Nozads path to Silicon Valley power broker–and VC investor with a net worth in the ballpark of $50 million–was a far simpler one: He sold carpets.",
"University Avenue reflects Palo Alto, Californias diversity in full. It starts as an exit off the Dumbarton Bridge, which cuts across the southern edge of San Francisco Bay, runs though rough-and-tumble East Palo Alto, then tree-lined stretches dotted with multimillion-dollar mansions, and eventually hits, as the name implies, the Stanford campus. A few hundred feet before that terminus, across from a Starbucks and a Thai restaurant, sits the Medallion Rug Gallery, a warehouselike store where for 34 years the Amidi family has been selling exquisite art forms that just happen to cover your floor.",
"In 1994 the family patriarch, Amir Amidi, found himself on the phone with Nozad, who despite no tangible experience and poor command of English had answered a television ad for a salesperson. Have you ever sold anything? Amidi asked the brash caller in Farsi.",
"No, but give me a chance, Nozad responded. How can you deny someone you havent even met?",
"Nozad had already learned that you cant get something if you dont ask. He grew up in Tehran, but in the 1980s Nozads family fled to Germany. Nozad intended to join them after his compulsory stint in Irans military service, which he would satisfy by playing soccer for the countrys premier team. When a military officer questioned his discharge, on account of his sporty tour of duty, Nozad found a high-level cleric and published an interview with him on the benefits of soccer–and then had that cleric expedite his discharge.",
"Within a month of rejoining his family in Mannheim, Germany with the intent of playing more soccer, his brother persuaded him to show up at the U.S. consulate and ask for a visa. It was a set-up of sorts. His brother was obsessed with American culture and went to the consulate almost daily, only to be denied. Nozad showed up one morning, mentioned his soccer interviewing days and promptly scored a journalism visa. Two months after that he was on a plane to San Francisco (where an uncle lived) with $700 and a few words of English.",
"He worked at a car wash in San Jose owned by Iranians and then a coffee and yogurt shop in Redwood City. He studied English at night, living in a small room above the shop cluttered with boxes of napkins, cups and coffee beans. Thats when he stumbled upon the carpet want ad placed, fortuitously, by an older Iranian immigrant who had made a success of himself after fleeing his homeland when the Shah was deposed.",
"My father had the experience, Pejman had the enthusiasm, says Amidis son, Saeed (Amidi died in 2000). The American dream works both ways. A lot of rich people have to share their knowledge and take risks with a young person. Thats how they stay rich. Its familiar, too. Someone did the same for them years ago.",
"Over the next 15 years, as his English and confidence improved, Nozad proved Amidis top rug seller, moving $8 million worth of floor coverings in his best year. But far more than that, he was an opportunist in the greatest sense: This American neophyte recognized that fate had bequeathed him access to the most ­important people in the most important region of the most important industry during its most important era.",
"So he made sure not to blow chances gift. Nozad insisted on meeting his clients at their homes, toting along 20 or so rugs (thats two hours of talking, at least). And before these visits he researched his hosts on Google, so that he could turn showing carpets into a two-way tutorial, peppering each ever so gently with questions about their careers, their tastes, their views on how the world works. It was awkward at first. But within months of the routine he had names to drop and technology trends to ponder. The smart ones understood me, he says. They got it. Theyd invite me to their office.",
"Nozad started playing host. He gathered some top VCs regularly at the rug store for meet-and-greet cocktails with entrepreneurs. People used to tease me for going there, says Sequoia Capitals veteran partner Doug Leone. At five oclock the rugs would go up and flat screens would come down. We were all immigrants … Italians like me, Iranian, Indians. I was very comfortable.",
"Nozad still didnt have any significant assets to speak of. But his boss, who had come to call Nozad his third son, had taken notice of his matchmaking skills. Amidi had also caught the VC bug. The family had purchased a small office building down the road from the rug store and took note as a tenant, Google, which had a few employees, exploded. Another tenant, PayPal, also grew out of its space–this time Amidi invested. We noticed everyone around us was making more money than we were, says Saeed Amidi. We wanted to be part of the big game.",
"In 1999 the Amidis formally launched an investment fund, cutting in Nozad as the de facto deal scout. It started with $2 million. Nozad kicked in $200,000, almost everything he had, for a one-third stake. The firms name, Amidzad, even blended the two family names. While their investments were relatively small stakes, Nozads hustle invariably earned him what Accel Partners Sameer Gandhi terms the Pejman exception.",
"He has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy, says Sequoias Leone, who has let Nozad co-invest with him in four different companies. Hes like me, from the earth.",
"Nozads first big bet was on a startup called Danger, which aimed to make handheld devices for exchanging data. Nozad had sold Dangers cofounder Andy Rubin a $5,000 rug. The deal took hours of negotiation, and Nozad was impressed. He inquired about Danger. He couldnt quite make sense of the technology, but after the first business meeting with Rubin (who now runs Googles Android division), Nozad turned to his mentor Amidi and said: I would invest in that guy if he was selling red balloons. He will make things happen. And so Amidzad wrote a check for $400,000.",
"Danger became a mobile phone software firm and was acquired by Microsoft for $500 million, but by then Amidzads stake had been diluted to a pittance. Nozad made just two times his investment over an eight-year stretch. Sam Ferdows was brought in as Amidzads lawyer soon after the Danger deal. His memory: Once a week Pejman was telling me about some new best deal ever. He was doing business with handshakes. And no one ever read the fine print. I dont think they even realized there was fine print. Once, he told me a guy was going to give us a piece of his carried interest. What the heck does that mean?",
"Nozad recognized his weakness and began doing deals only if someone more experienced, and whom he liked, was willing to put up funds, too. One of his first such helpers was Babak Bobby Yazdani, an early investor in Google and Salesforce.com. He advised Marc Benioff on his first key recruits and also founded Saba, a human resources software company. Nozad sold Yazdani a few rugs and then asked him to meet a chip designer with a startup idea. Why didnt Yazdani just blow him off politely? Yazdani explains, Theres a lot of humility in our culture. Im talking about immigrants and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. We all had just our families and our educations when we came here. So when someone who you have a relationship with asks you to do something, you do it. Its a courtesy but also a discipline.",
"Yazdani has since invested in eight startups with Nozad. Hes one hook that makes Nozads money attractive. Joe Lonsdale already had one hit under his belt when he attended a dinner hosted by Nozad at a Persian restaurant. He had cofounded data-mining outfit Palantir and had many suitors knocking when he left to launch his second venture, a private wealth management technology service called Addepar. Nozad insisted Lonsdale meet with him and Yazdani. He delicately pushed the idea of meeting at Lonsdales Los Altos house. Then he watched how Lonsdale and Yazdani interacted. As for Lonsdale: I like Pejman. I needed Bobby. He knows how to evolve a startup. I didnt know how to build a management structure over time.",
"Nozad sought out technology ­advisors, too. Lou Montulli, a founding engineer at Netscape, was one of his first Silicon Valley friends. In 1997 Montulli wandered into the rug store owning three rugs from an ex-wife and an expensive decorator. He wanted to have them cleaned or, better yet, get rid of them. Nozad quickly had him buying two more rugs. He now has 20 in ­various homes. Nozad showed him ­antique looms and videos of weavers and walked him through the history of Irans rug industry. He made me appreciate the craft, says Montulli, who then brought in other Netscape millionaires in need of rugs. Over time they talked technology, and Nozad started introducing Montulli to entrepreneurs. It seems like such a leap from rugs to startups. But he was seeing amazing deal flow. He built a great network, and thats one of the keys to doing this successfully, says Montulli.",
"Nozads instincts werent perfect– most notably, he walked away from a stake in Facebook and instead invested in Stanfords ill-fated version of a social network, Affinity Circles. But his track record overall was formidable, as many of his early investments were gobbled by the tech giants at prices five times what he put in, including Vudu, Vivu, Bix and Milo. While far from wealthy, he was living a proper American dream.",
"And then he spotted two young entrepreneurs, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, at a TechCrunch conference in 2007 toting the demo of a cloud storage system they called Dropbox. He cornered Ferdowsi, chatting him up in Farsi, and within days had the pair visiting him at the rug shop. Escorted to the back room for mu­sic and Persian tea, Houston was sure that it was all a joke. I was waiting for the candid cameras to show up, he remembers.",
"But within a day Nozad had Dropbox pitching Sequoia for funds. Hed called his buddy Leone, who then e-mailed Houston for a meeting. He was our biggest booster, and wed met the guy that week, Houston adds. Two days later Sequoia partner Mike Moritz dropped in early on Houston and Ferdowsi at their apartment to make the final decision. And two days after that Nozad inserted himself into a dinner at Pane e Vino in San Francisco, where Sequoia partner Sameer Gandhi (now at Accel), Houston and Ferdowsi hammered out a $1.2 million seed round.",
"Nozad barely said a word but made sure to leave that night with a piece in Dropbox for Amidzad. Hed done the introduction, and we wanted to do right by him, says Gandhi. Based on Dropboxs recent $250 million raise, at a $4 billion valuation, that stake is currently worth $80 million.",
"Its a Wednesday evening in January, and Nozad is on a typical adventure. Hes wandering through a wood-paneled library at Stonebrook Court, a 30,000-square-foot Tudor mansion and estate owned by his buddy Kelly Porter in Los Altos Hills just north of San Jose. Dreary 19th-century paintings cover the walls. A warm flame crackles in a carved marble fireplace. Can you believe this exists here? Nozad says.",
"Porter works for a mergers and acquisitions advisory firm. Hes doing a favor of sorts for Nozad. Earlier in the day two dozen investment bankers and deal lawyers gathered in the ballroom of Stonebrook Court as the heads of corporate development from Google, Facebook, Twitter and other top firms divulged where theyre looking to do acquisitions. Nozad was invited, then asked to bring a few of his entrepreneurs. He didnt push introductions at the Stonebrook soiree. When an M&A lawyer asks Nozad what he does, he says he invests in amazing people.",
"Later that night Nozad has gathered seven of his entrepreneurs at a New Orleans-style restaurant in Palo Alto. Three are Iranian. The conversation drifts away from business models to stories of family back home. There are tales of nighttime caravans smuggling family members into the Afghan desert and talk about the years spent in limbo awaiting life in a better place. Nozads eyes moisten as he describes a trip he took to Iran a few years ago, bringing along his wife of 19 years (his childhood sweetheart from Tehran) and his son and daughter.",
"Hes come a long way from charming clerics into a military discharge. Two years ago Nozad decided to invest independently of Amidzad. He still does deals with the family, but more are solo, where he is betting his own money. I realized Im actually kind of good at this, he says. I wanted focus. Hes­already sitting on several windfalls besides Dropbox, including Addepar, the social networking site Path, social charity startup Causes and a gaming outfit, Badgeville. And he still sells carpets–hes founded his own upscale rug gallery, bringing in his brother to run it.",
"Nozads 7 Networking Tips",
"1. Always be willing and eager to help others with an introduction or your time. And do not expect anything in return.",
"2. Be proud of where you came from and share that with others. It shows honesty and builds trust.",
"3. Compliment the achievements of those around you, and do it with a smile.",
"4. In conversations search for a common ground. It may take a while, but there is surely something to bring you closer.",
"5. Use your Rolodex wisely and only for the right person and the right time, with the right cause.",
"6. Make sure you understand what the person you want help from has to gain from it.",
"7. Dont create walls between your personal and professional lives. It is one big network of people."

"It was three months into my solo road trip when I grew genuinely scared. I'd been pitching my tent across the country, but I had rolled into Bar Harbor, Maine, on July 4 only to discover all the campgrounds and hotels were full. Wouldn't you know: The grand celebration of our freedom left me with nowhere to stay. So I parked my car in Acadia National Park, because I figured serial killers wouldn't bother with the entrance fee, and I curled up in the backseat with the only protection I had: A ball peen hammer, and a teddy bear.",
"Yes, I carried a teddy bear with me on my swashbuckling Jack Kerouac adventure. It was a gift from my high school boyfriend, and it reminded me of being loved, and I had dragged it along the ground of the previous decade, across college and my first career and various romantic disappointments. That bear was a kind of battle armor, even as it squished up against my face.",
"And I needed it that night, because my mind was a haunted house of broken glass and men in ski masks lurching from the shadows. There were so many reasons to be frightened while traveling alone – 18-wheelers, lightning storms, roadside motels that reeked of death – but the most formidable was my own imagination. I told myself I'd be fine, that no one would find me here, but I was wrong, because I was startled awake by a flashlight flooding the window at 3 a.m.",
"\"Ma'am, you can't sleep here,\" said the park ranger. I tumbled out of the car, barefoot, and how strange I must have looked to him: the ball peen hammer swinging from one hand, the teddy bear from the other. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could see his face, a mixture of amusement and disbelief. What the hell are you doing here?",
"The truth was, I didn't know.",
"At the age of 27, I got in my aquamarine Honda and drove 26,000 miles around the country for five months by myself. It was foolish and lonely and 10 years later, I still think it might be the best thing I've ever done. I wore clothes till they were filthy and lived on baked beans and peanut butter, but the luxury of that time is unimaginable to me now, because I woke up every morning with no one's agenda but my own. What did I want to see today? Where did I want to go?",
"I've been thinking about that trip recently, because I've been reading Cheryl Strayed's \"Wild,\" an account of her foolish and lonely solo walk along the Pacific Crest Trail at the age of 26. As far as feats of fortitude go, Strayed blows me out of the water. She loses her toenails. She swallows her own mother's ashes. Meanwhile, I visited the Cereal Museum at the Mall of America (and I highly recommend it).",
"But what we shared was a reckless sense of adventure and a grandiosity to believe we could make such a journey in the first place, when many people were ready to convince us we could not. A woman traveling alone threatens tradition and propriety. And because women often doubt themselves, we stay toward safe harbors and soft landings, hiding behind the needs and wants of others.",
"I spent my mid-20s in this crouch of safety. My friends scattered to both coasts after college, but I stayed in the same city where we went to school, in the same state where I'd grown up. I got a good job at an alt weekly. I learned to shoot pool. But I hid behind 20 extra pounds and a pyramid of empty beer cans. I would get these honking crushes on guys at work — I lived lifetimes with them in my mind — but I would run into them at the printer and be all blank stares and whatever.",
"My female friends were not like this. They were crashing against the rocks of 20-something relationships in a way that was thrilling and age-appropriate – living with boyfriends, dating older men, dating women. But I spent the ages of 23, and 24, and 25 drumming my fingers on the table, waiting for a big romance that never arrived.",
"Men had always been the instigators of adventure for me. It was my older brother I stumbled behind as a little girl, tripping along the ground to try to keep his pace. It was my college boyfriend who whisked me out to Colorado two weeks after we met, where we drove all night and slept under the stars. I kept thinking if I met the guy, then I would lose the weight, I would stop drinking myself into a coma, I would crawl out of my hidey-hole.",
"But I knew in my heart that the opposite was true. No one could rescue me from my own isolation. The first line of \"David Copperfield\" kicked around my mind: \"Whether I shall be the hero of my own life, or whether that position will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.\"",
"If you are lucky, you stop seeing the world as a series of things you do not have — a boyfriend, a baby, an adorable terrier – and you start noticing the things you do have. A healthy bank account, unburdened by mortgages or school loans. No romantic ties. Loving parents who wanted nothing but happiness for me. Years to burn. That kind of freedom is like a command from the universe to get off your ass and do something amazing.",
"And so, at the age of 26, I quit my job and went to travel in South America for four months. It was amazing, although I don't need to tell you about it now, partly because that is not the point of this essay, and partly because I am the kind of person who can't read about someone else's mind-blowing world travel without quietly seething with envy. Oh, I'm so happy you saw the face of God in the stones of Machu Picchu, I'll just be over here dribbling this Chipotle burrito down the front of my shirt and dying inside.",
"The point of this essay is that I went by myself, and doing so made me wonder what else I could do alone. A map of the world became like a series of boxes unchecked. I kept thinking about my 401K — $7,000 gathering dust in a series of graphs and charts that arrived in the mail each month. I kept thinking about those swaggering tales of men blazing across American asphalt: Soaring down Route 66 with the windows down, sliding into some corner booth while a waitress called them \"honey.\" Travel can be an addiction, and five months on the road suited that greediness in me. I didn't want to go to one place; I wanted to go to all places. I wanted to run my hands across the entire continent.",
"And so I drove up the Pacific Coast Highway. I drove to Alaska. I drove across Montana and up into Quebec. Some of my friends were so excited by my trip that they joined me on two-week legs. I wrote about my travels on a blog, and strangers emailed me tips for their cities before I'd even arrived.",
"Not everyone loved this plan. My parents, for instance. But my mother is partly to blame for my wanderlust in the first place. I had grown up hearing tales of her trips to Germany and Austria as a young woman. She traded the cost of an engagement ring to my father for a chance to hike around in the Black Forest, which I thought was the coolest thing ever – to commit to travel and marriage all at once. (My parents are still together.) So she sucked up my eccentric journeys, and settled for a call from every port. It wasn't easy for her. The world is a wicked place, and no one likes the thought of their only daughter swallowing fear and vulnerability on a daily basis. But at some point, every one of us must stare down this calculation: How safe do we want to be? How much of ourselves are we willing to give up for it?",
"Yes, I was scared at times, but I had also been scared sitting on my futon watching \"The Real World.\" (Scared of the phone, scared of the future, scared of what people said about me.) The far more terrifying fate, as I saw it, was that I would fail to become the person I wanted to be. I still wasn't sure what that was yet. I spent much of those five months feeling like a kite dangling on a string. Was I going to head to grad school? Write for television? Open my own school? My mind filled with clouds. But my God, it was fun. It was boring, too. I took eight-hour hikes and let my mind wander, or sang the \"Xanadu\" soundtrack for the 18 billionth time.",
"I also made incredibly stupid decisions. One night, while walking to my friend John's house in Portland, Maine, I climbed in the car of a strange man who offered me a ride because he thought I was cute. I know better than this, but I was buzzed on five beers and the whiff of danger. He got lost almost immediately, and I grew nervous, and at some point, he started yelling at me, \"So you think I'm a rapist? You think I'm going to kill you?\" And the answers to those questions were yes, and yes.",
"But he did not. Instead, he called me a bitch and dropped me off at John's place, where he had grown panicked with worry. \"You can't do that,\" John said, pacing the floor as he spoke. \"Promise me you'll never do that again.\"",
"And I felt bad, but I also thought he was being unfair: John spent his 20s hopping on rail cars and dumpster diving. He joined the Hari Krishnas. He was a wild-eyed wanderer, and now he lived in a comfy Victorian in Portland, Maine, and was giving me lectures about stranger danger. Why? Just because I was a girl?",
"I didn't get it. And it took me years of harrowing escapades and narrow scrapes to get it. Climbing into that car wasn't stupid because I was a woman. It was stupid, period.",
"So I had a lot to learn about taking care of myself, but I was on my way. In the years since, I feel a jolt of excitement whenever I hear about a woman traveling alone, whether she's a single woman surfing in Costa Rica or a married journalist dropping into a war zone or a mother going to the wilds of Africa, discovering what quiet sounds like when it unfolds around her. Such exotic forays are out of reach for many people – including me, for most of my life. But I also think you can take a day hike by yourself, you can travel to the lake by yourself. And what you find is a reassurance that you can stand on your own in the world.",
"There is a poignant scene near the end of \"Wild.\" Cheryl Strayed's mother is close to death, and she tells her daughter, \"I never got to be in the driver's seat of my own life … I always did what someone else wanted me to do. I've always been someone else's daughter or mother or wife. I've never just been me.\"",
"God, that moment cut me. Boyfriends are nice, and careers are important, but I think this is all I've ever been after: to just be me.",
"I can't travel much these days. I don't have the money. I have a cat I love beyond all reason, who is old and tired. But I also found that I had to stop moving every time I grew uncomfortable. Being in the driver's seat of your own life is grand, but it requires knowing when you are out of gas. I try to keep a traveler's eyes. I take expeditions to strange suburbs. I take expeditions to the 7-11. (Behold: Corn Nuts in their native environment!) After years of movement, my challenge now is to sit still.",
"But I also try to hold on to the girl who was young and stupid enough to believe in foolish adventures, the girl who was equal parts ready to fall in love with you and hurl a ball peen hammer into your front windshield. I had a strength I did not realize, but one I did not forget. When I am restless and defeated and scared again, I tell myself this: that the greatest trip of my life came because I did not get the things I wanted.",
"I wish you the same.",

"The question my title poses, of course, is the one that is classically aimed at humanities majors. What practical value could there possibly be in studying literature or art or philosophy? So you must be wondering why I'm bothering to raise it here, at Stanford, this renowned citadel of science and technology. What doubt can there be that the world will offer you many opportunities to use your degree?",
"But that's not the question I'm asking. By \"do\" I don't mean a job, and by \"that\" I don't mean your major. We are more than our jobs, and education is more than a major. Education is more than college, more even than the totality of your formal schooling, from kindergarten through graduate school. By \"What are you going to do,\" I mean, what kind of life are you going to lead? And by \"that,\" I mean everything in your training, formal and informal, that has brought you to be sitting here today, and everything you're going to be doing for the rest of the time that you're in school.",
"We should start by talking about how you did, in fact, get here. You got here by getting very good at a certain set of skills. Your parents pushed you to excel from the time you were very young. They sent you to good schools, where the encouragement of your teachers and the example of your peers helped push you even harder. Your natural aptitudes were nurtured so that, in addition to excelling in all your subjects, you developed a number of specific interests that you cultivated with particular vigor. You did extracurricular activities, went to afterschool programs, took private lessons. You spent summers doing advanced courses at a local college or attending skill-specific camps and workshops. You worked hard, you paid attention, and you tried your very best. And so you got very good at math, or piano, or lacrosse, or, indeed, several things at once.",
"Now there's nothing wrong with mastering skills, with wanting to do your best and to be the best. What's wrong is what the system leaves out: which is to say, everything else. I don't mean that by choosing to excel in math, say, you are failing to develop your verbal abilities to their fullest extent, or that in addition to focusing on geology, you should also focus on political science, or that while you're learning the piano, you should also be working on the flute. It is the nature of specialization, after all, to be specialized. No, the problem with specialization is that it narrows your attention to the point where all you know about and all you want to know about, and, indeed, all you can know about, is your specialty.",
"The problem with specialization is that it makes you into a specialist. It cuts you off, not only from everything else in the world, but also from everything else in yourself. And of course, as college freshmen, your specialization is only just beginning. In the journey toward the success that you all hope to achieve, you have completed, by getting into Stanford, only the first of many legs. Three more years of college, three or four or five years of law school or medical school or a Ph.D. program, then residencies or postdocs or years as a junior associate. In short, an ever-narrowing funnel of specialization. You go from being a political-science major to being a lawyer to being a corporate attorney to being a corporate attorney focusing on taxation issues in the consumer-products industry. You go from being a biochemistry major to being a doctor to being a cardiologist to being a cardiac surgeon who performs heart-valve replacements.",
"Again, there's nothing wrong with being those things. It's just that, as you get deeper and deeper into the funnel, into the tunnel, it becomes increasingly difficult to remember who you once were. You start to wonder what happened to that person who played piano and lacrosse and sat around with her friends having intense conversations about life and politics and all the things she was learning in her classes. The 19-year-old who could do so many things, and was interested in so many things, has become a 40-year-old who thinks about only one thing. That's why older people are so boring. \"Hey, my dad's a smart guy, but all he talks about is money and livers.\"",
"And there's another problem. Maybe you never really wanted to be a cardiac surgeon in the first place. It just kind of happened. It's easy, the way the system works, to simply go with the flow. I don't mean the work is easy, but the choices are easy. Or rather, the choices sort of make themselves. You go to a place like Stanford because that's what smart kids do. You go to medical school because it's prestigious. You specialize in cardiology because it's lucrative. You do the things that reap the rewards, that make your parents proud, and your teachers pleased, and your friends impressed. From the time you started high school and maybe even junior high, your whole goal was to get into the best college you could, and so now you naturally think about your life in terms of \"getting into\" whatever's next. \"Getting into\" is validation; \"getting into\" is victory. Stanford, then Johns Hopkins medical school, then a residency at the University of San Francisco, and so forth. Or Michigan Law School, or Goldman Sachs, or Mc­Kinsey, or whatever. You take it one step at a time, and the next step always seems to be inevitable.",
"Or maybe you did always want to be a cardiac surgeon. You dreamed about it from the time you were 10 years old, even though you had no idea what it really meant, and you stayed on course for the entire time you were in school. You refused to be enticed from your path by that great experience you had in AP history, or that trip you took to Costa Rica the summer after your junior year in college, or that terrific feeling you got taking care of kids when you did your rotation in pediatrics during your fourth year in medical school.",
"But either way, either because you went with the flow or because you set your course very early, you wake up one day, maybe 20 years later, and you wonder what happened: how you got there, what it all means. Not what it means in the \"big picture,\" whatever that is, but what it means to you. Why you're doing it, what it's all for. It sounds like a cliché, this \"waking up one day,\" but it's called having a midlife crisis, and it happens to people all the time.",
"There is an alternative, however, and it may be one that hasn't occurred to you. Let me try to explain it by telling you a story about one of your peers, and the alternative that hadn't occurred to her. A couple of years ago, I participated in a panel discussion at Harvard that dealt with some of these same matters, and afterward I was contacted by one of the students who had come to the event, a young woman who was writing her senior thesis about Harvard itself, how it instills in its students what she called self-efficacy, the sense that you can do anything you want. Self-efficacy, or, in more familiar terms, self-esteem. There are some kids, she said, who get an A on a test and say, \"I got it because it was easy.\" And there are other kids, the kind with self-efficacy or self-esteem, who get an A on a test and say, \"I got it because I'm smart.\"",
"Again, there's nothing wrong with thinking that you got an A because you're smart. But what that Harvard student didn't realize—and it was really quite a shock to her when I suggested it—is that there is a third alternative. True self-esteem, I proposed, means not caring whether you get an A in the first place. True self-esteem means recognizing, despite everything that your upbringing has trained you to believe about yourself, that the grades you get—and the awards, and the test scores, and the trophies, and the acceptance letters—are not what defines who you are.",
"She also claimed, this young woman, that Harvard students take their sense of self-efficacy out into the world and become, as she put it, \"innovative.\" But when I asked her what she meant by innovative, the only example she could come up with was \"being CEO of a Fortune 500.\" That's not innovative, I told her, that's just successful, and successful according to a very narrow definition of success. True innovation means using your imagination, exercising the capacity to envision new possibilities.",
"But I'm not here to talk about technological innovation, I'm here to talk about a different kind. It's not about inventing a new machine or a new drug. It's about inventing your own life. Not following a path, but making your own path. The kind of imagination I'm talking about is moral imagination. \"Moral\" meaning not right or wrong, but having to do with making choices. Moral imagination means the capacity to envision new ways to live your life.",
"It means not just going with the flow. It means not just \"getting into\" whatever school or program comes next. It means figuring out what you want for yourself, not what your parents want, or your peers want, or your school wants, or your society wants. Originating your own values. Thinking your way toward your own definition of success. Not simply accepting the life that you've been handed. Not simply accepting the choices you've been handed. When you walk into Starbucks, you're offered a choice among a latte and a macchiato and an espresso and a few other things, but you can also make another choice. You can turn around and walk out. When you walk into college, you are offered a choice among law and medicine and investment banking and consulting and a few other things, but again, you can also do something else, something that no one has thought of before.",
"Let me give you another counterexample. I wrote an essay a couple of years ago that touched on some of these same points. I said, among other things, that kids at places like Yale or Stanford tend to play it safe and go for the conventional rewards. And one of the most common criticisms I got went like this: What about Teach for America? Lots of kids from elite colleges go and do TFA after they graduate, so therefore I was wrong. TFA, TFA—I heard that over and over again. And Teach for America is undoubtedly a very good thing. But to cite TFA in response to my argument is precisely to miss the point, and to miss it in a way that actually confirms what I'm saying. The problem with TFA—or rather, the problem with the way that TFA has become incorporated into the system—is that it's just become another thing to get into.",
"In terms of its content, Teach for America is completely different from Goldman Sachs or McKinsey or Harvard Medical School or Berkeley Law, but in terms of its place within the structure of elite expectations, of elite choices, it is exactly the same. It's prestigious, it's hard to get into, it's something that you and your parents can brag about, it looks good on your résumé, and most important, it represents a clearly marked path. You don't have to make it up yourself, you don't have to do anything but apply and do the work­—just like college or law school or McKinsey or whatever. It's the Stanford or Harvard of social engagement. It's another hurdle, another badge. It requires aptitude and diligence, but it does not require a single ounce of moral imagination.",
"Moral imagination is hard, and it's hard in a completely different way than the hard things you're used to doing. And not only that, it's not enough. If you're going to invent your own life, if you're going to be truly autonomous, you also need courage: moral courage. The courage to act on your values in the face of what everyone's going to say and do to try to make you change your mind. Because they're not going to like it. Morally courageous individuals tend to make the people around them very uncomfortable. They don't fit in with everybody else's ideas about the way the world is supposed to work, and still worse, they make them feel insecure about the choices that they themselves have made—or failed to make. People don't mind being in prison as long as no one else is free. But stage a jailbreak, and everybody else freaks out.",
"In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, James Joyce has Stephen Dedalus famously say, about growing up in Ireland in the late 19th century, \"When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.\"",
"Today there are other nets. One of those nets is a term that I've heard again and again as I've talked with students about these things. That term is \"self-indulgent.\" \"Isn't it self-indulgent to try to live the life of the mind when there are so many other things I could be doing with my degree?\" \"Wouldn't it be self-indulgent to pursue painting after I graduate instead of getting a real job?\"",
"These are the kinds of questions that young people find themselves being asked today if they even think about doing something a little bit different. Even worse, the kinds of questions they are made to feel compelled to ask themselves. Many students have spoken to me, as they navigated their senior years, about the pressure they felt from their peers—from their peers—to justify a creative or intellectual life. You're made to feel like you're crazy: crazy to forsake the sure thing, crazy to think it could work, crazy to imagine that you even have a right to try.",
"Think of what we've come to. It is one of the great testaments to the intellectual—and moral, and spiritual—poverty of American society that it makes its most intelligent young people feel like they're being self-indulgent if they pursue their curiosity. You are all told that you're supposed to go to college, but you're also told that you're being \"self-indulgent\" if you actually want to get an education. Or even worse, give yourself one. As opposed to what? Going into consulting isn't self-indulgent? Going into finance isn't self-indulgent? Going into law, like most of the people who do, in order to make yourself rich, isn't self-indulgent? It's not OK to play music, or write essays, because what good does that really do anyone, but it is OK to work for a hedge fund. It's selfish to pursue your passion, unless it's also going to make you a lot of money, in which case it's not selfish at all.",
"Do you see how absurd this is? But these are the nets that are flung at you, and this is what I mean by the need for courage. And it's a never-ending proc­ess. At that Harvard event two years ago, one person said, about my assertion that college students needed to keep rethinking the decisions they've made about their lives, \"We already made our decisions, back in middle school, when we decided to be the kind of high achievers who get into Harvard.\" And I thought, who wants to live with the decisions that they made when they were 12? Let me put that another way. Who wants to let a 12-year-old decide what they're going to do for the rest of their lives? Or a 19-year-old, for that matter?",
"All you can decide is what you think now, and you need to be prepared to keep making revisions. Because let me be clear. I'm not trying to persuade you all to become writers or musicians. Being a doctor or a lawyer, a scientist or an engineer or an economist—these are all valid and admirable choices. All I'm saying is that you need to think about it, and think about it hard. All I'm asking is that you make your choices for the right reasons. All I'm urging is that you recognize and embrace your moral freedom.",
"And most of all, don't play it safe. Resist the seductions of the cowardly values our society has come to prize so highly: comfort, convenience, security, predictability, control. These, too, are nets. Above all, resist the fear of failure. Yes, you will make mistakes. But they will be your mistakes, not someone else's. And you will survive them, and you will know yourself better for having made them, and you will be a fuller and a stronger person.",
"It's been said—and I'm not sure I agree with this, but it's an idea that's worth taking seriously—that you guys belong to a \"postemotional\" generation. That you prefer to avoid messy and turbulent and powerful feelings. But I say, don't shy away from the challenging parts of yourself. Don't deny the desires and curiosities, the doubts and dissatisfactions, the joy and the darkness, that might knock you off the path that you have set for yourself. College is just beginning for you, adulthood is just beginning. Open yourself to the possibilities they represent. The world is much larger than you can imagine right now. Which means, you are much larger than you can imagine."

"1 - You don't need to have a plan when you get together with a friend.",
"You don't need to have a party, an activity, or brunch you're supposed to go to together. You can see a friend with nothing on the agenda, just wanting to get together and decide what you'll do after.",
"2 – A true friend:",
"… Doesn't judge you, but also has the right to not approve of your full body tattoo.",
"… Is ready to drop everything she's doing and come to your rescue if you have an emergency, but also knows when to tell you when you're overreacting.",
"… Has the right to be pissed at you when you overreact, but not for too long.",
"3 - A true friend:",
"… Doesn't make a move on your ex.",
"… Doesn't make a move on your boyfriend!!! (This stays true for crypto-moves too \"Haaaa, you're so smaaart!\")",
"… Doesn't steal your friends!!! (Unless you encourage her to do so).",

"7 - Some friendships die, but it doesn't mean they weren't beautiful and true.",
"8 - Stupid Problems that can Kill a Friendship if not Kept in Check:",
"Jealousy: Jealousy stems from desire. Before you hate someone because she has everything you want, you usually start by loving her from everything she has. Keep yourself in check.",
"Money: In friendships, as in love, everyone gives what they can, whether that be affection, money, intelligence, experience, contacts, what ever it is… You have to be generous, and let others be generous too, even if it's just paying for coffee.",
"Distance: You have to pick up the phone and call. Skype, text, whatever it is. I'm the worst at this and I can't even get it together to respond to e-mails. Friendships have suffered… That said, I'd never hold it against a friend if they are too busy and don't have time to call – I know they are busy, I don't think they are forgetting me… Which maybe explains my behavior.

"11 - Some profound friendships can be formed in three minutes, other superficial ones can take years.",
"12 - With a true friend, you can be completely yourself.",
"You don't need to be the girl who's \"cool with tons of friends, a great job and an awesome boyfriend, wahoooo!\" You're just you.",
"13 – Sign of a true friendship: Even after not seeing each other for three years, you feel like you're picking up a conversation you didn't quite finish the day before.",
"14 - Sign of a true friendship: after 35 years of friendship, you still laugh together like teenagers (my mom and her best friend, so awesome).",
"That's all for now! There are many other things – Plus, I have an amazing theory about jealousy that I can tell you about next time – but for the moment, that's what appeared to us as the base of the base of the base. Big kisses my friends !"

			"title": "The Psychology of Language: Why Are Some Words More Persuasive Than Others?",
			"headline": "What's actually going on in the brain when it processes language? And if words affect the mind in different ways, are some more persuasive than others? Buffer cofounder Leo Widrich dives into what the research has to say about this and more.",
			"contents": [
"Here's a secret right off the bat and I hope it isn't too odd: one of the things I fuss about a lot, especially for Buffer copy (for example our welcome email if you sign up!) are words—very simple words, in fact. Should it say \"Hi\" or \"Hey\"? Should it be \"cheers\" or \"thanks\"? How about \"but\" or \"and\"? I'm guessing you might have a similar obsession with this. There are many occasions when [my Buffer partner] Joel and I sit over one line and change it multiple times, until we feel it really sits right. This is partly to improve our metrics for click rate and others. It's also to simply create an emotion. The one key question we ask ourselves is: \"How does this make you feel?\"",
"That question might sound very obvious. And yet, it's a very different question than, \"Which message do you want to send?\" or \"What is the content of this announcement?\" By always focusing on \"How will this make someone feel?\" when you write even a single line, we immediately improved the amount of responses we got from our users. Let's dig in to how our brain works and expose some of the most persuasive words in English.",
"Our Brain While Listening to Words",
"Recently, a lot of the long standing paradigms in how our brain processes language were overthrown. New and cutting edge studies that produced quite startling and different results. The one study I found most interesting is UCL's findings on how we can separate words from intonation. Whenever we listen to words, this is what happens: \"Words are then shunted over to the left temporal lobe [of our brain] for processing, while the melody is channelled to the right side of the brain, a region more stimulated by music.\"",
"So our brain uses two different areas to identify the mood and then the actual meaning of the words. On second thought, what still doesn't quite make sense is why we can even distinguish \"language\" so distinctly from any other sounds.",
"The UCL team tried to find out about exactly this. They played speech sounds and then non-speech sounds, that still sounded similar to speech to people. Whilst measuring their brain activity, they found something fascinating: \"Speech was singled out for special treatment near the primary auditory cortex.\" In short, our brains can magically single out language from any other sounds and port it to the right \"department\" in our brain to give it meaning.",
"This graphic also gives a great overview about how our brain process language:",
"The Psychology of Language: Why Are Some Words More Persuasive Than Others?",
"So intonation and actual wording matters, but what is the split?",
"The Myth of the \"55% Body Language, 38% Tone of Voice, 7% Actual Words\" Rule",
"You've probably heard this statistic many times before. Only in recent years have people explored again what the contents of that study were. The study dates back to 1967 had a very different purpose. It wasn't at all about defining how we process language: \"The fact is Professor Mehrabian's research had nothing to do with giving speeches, because it was based on the information that could be conveyed in a single word.\"",
"Here is what actually happened that triggered the above result:",
"\"Subjects were asked to listen to a recording of a woman's voice saying the word \"maybe\" three different ways to convey liking, neutrality, and disliking. They were also shown photos of the woman's face conveying the same three emotions. They were then asked to guess the emotions heard in the recorded voice, seen in the photos, and both together. The result? The subjects correctly identified the emotions 50 percent more often from the photos than from the voice.\"",
"The truth, so famous author Philip Yaffe argues, is that the actual words \"must dominate by a wide margin.\"",
"Facial Expression, Brevity, and Avoiding Adjectives in Speech",
"Smiling: the highest positive emotional gesture",
"There are, of course, a number of other most powerful elements to consider when thinking about speech. One of the most important ones that researcher Andrew Newberg uncovers in his book Words Can Change Your Brain is facial expressions that we carry. Newberg explains his reasoning for why the Mona Lisa's content smile turned into one of the most well known paintings around the world: \"We know that smiling is a very powerful gesture; we were doing a research study looking at different symbols, and the symbol that was rated with the highest positive emotional content was the smiley face. The painting of the Mona Lisa is one particular example of that feeling of calmness.\"",
"Talk no longer than 30 seconds in a given conversation",
"Another element for how we can process language is the number of words there are for us to process. Of course we know this as somewhat obvious and yet it's always a great reminder: \"The human brain can really only hold on to four things at a time, so if you go on and on for five or 10 minutes trying to argue a point, the person will only remember a very small part of that.\"",
"Instead, 30 seconds is the optimal amount for us to speak at any given time says Newberg: \"Speak briefly, meaning that you speak one or two sentences, maybe 30 seconds worth or so, because that's really what the human brain can take in.\"",
"Avoid adjectives in speech and writing",
"Something I struggle with is to stop using adjectives. They are, in fact, one of the worst elements of speech and even make a listener or reader lose trust. Writer Kim Peres explains: \"Using single words to describe actions and objects quickly brings them to mind. When someone \"stabs\" a straw into their drink we see it, but \"pokes swiftly\" is not so clear. When a person \"meanders\" it is more accurate than \"walking slowly.\" A man whose foot is described as a \"hoof\" is much more vivid that having \"gnarled toes and sole.\"",
"Reading this, hit me like a rock and couldn't make it any more clear I think. Peres goes on to explain that \"too much unnecessary text induces skipping\", which shows how detrimental adjectives can be. What we easily forget on a very high level is that using less words builds trust. So any words that don't convey meaning can erode our readers and listeners interest. I think this is one of the most important elements I want to keep reminding myself of.",
"Three Ideas to Keep in Mind When Using Language",
"The skill of asking questions: \"What would you do?\"",
"When I read this, I realized, I totally suck at it. One of the best journalists and now turned entrepreneur Evan Ratliff put it like this: \"All that's really saved me (so far) from madness is being able to formulate questions that deliver useful answers.\" He points out that any questions that start with \"who,\" \"what,\" \"where,\" \"when,\" \"how,\" or \"why\" are likely to get great responses. To be avoided are \"would,\" \"should,\" \"is,\" \"are,\" and \"do you think\", as they can limit how people respond to you a lot. To give an example:",
"Good: \"What would you do?\"",
"Bad: \"Would you do X?\"",
"Terrible: \"Would you do X or Y or Z or Q or M or W or … ?\"",
"His advice is to practice questions that begin with the 5Ws in order to have more meaningful conversations.",
"Removing \"is\" from your language",
"This next one is super interesting. Alfred Korzybski, the creator of General Semantics, was firmly convinced that the 'to be' verbs like \"I am, he is, they are, we are\" promoted insanity. Why? Quite simply because things can't be exactly equal to something else. Douglas Cartwright explains further: \"This X = Y creates all kinds of mental anguish and it doesn't need to because we never can reduce ourselves to single concepts. You believe yourself to have more complexity than that, don't you? Yet unconsciously accepting this languaging constrains us to believe we operate as nothing more or less than the idea we identified ourselves with.\"",
"Read the following list of examples and you'll see immediately how different the outcome of the statements is:",
"He is an idiot vs. He acted like an idiot in my eyes",
"She is depressed vs. She looks depressed to me",
"I am a failure vs. I think I've failed at this task",
"I am convinced that vs. It appears to me that",
"You, Because, Free , Instantly, New: The 5 Most Persuasive Words in English",
"In a terrific article, Gregory Ciotti researched the top five words in English. His list is not suprising and yet the research behind it, is extremely powerful.P",
"You: or your name is something that's so easy to be forgotten and yet so important for great communication.",
"Free: Gregory explains Ariely's principle of loss aversion. All of us naturally go for the lowest hanging fruit and free triggers exactly that.",
"The Psychology of Language: Why Are Some Words More Persuasive Than Others?",
"Because: Because is probably as dangerous as it is useful. Creating a causal relationship is incredibly persuasive: \"even giving weak reasons have been shown to be more persuasive than giving no reason at all.\"",
"Instantly: If we can trigger something immediately, our brain jumps on it like a shark, says Greg: \"Words like \"instant,\" \"immediately,\" or even\"fast\" are triggers for flipping the switch on that mid-brain activity.\"",
"Quick last fact: Make three positive comments for every negative statement; and for every negative argument give three positive ones. This comes from Andrew Newberg. His research suggests that negative arguments have a very detrimental effect to our brain. We need to pay particular attention to not let them take over and working agains them with this 3-to-1 ratio: \"When you get into a dialogue with somebody to discuss any particular issue, a three-to-one ratio is a relatively good benchmark to think about; you wind up creating the opportunity for a more constructive dialogue and hopefully a better resolution.\""

"In the past few years, I've bought eighty-one leather jackets. Dozens of boots and leather gloves. I've purchased pants that cost $5,000. I own a $22,000 coat. This winter I took a tour of Milan's Fashion Week (all expenses paid by Gucci, in appreciation of my many, many purchases), where I spent tens of thousands more and began to seriously grapple, once and for all, with a compulsion that could cost me more than just my life savings. My name is Buzz Bissinger. I am 58 years old, the best-selling author of 'Friday Night Lights,' father of three, husband. And I am a shopaholic.",

"AT 12:30 PM",
"FALL WINTER 2013-2014",
"MEN'S COLLECTION",
"PIAZZA OBERDAN 2/B MILAN",
"When I look at it, holding it with two hands, of course, because of its weight, I am struck by the incongruity of how I ended up here. It isn't every day that a journalist who majors in writing about the culture of sports in America, with a minor in the cult of high school football as an outgrowth of my 1990 book, Friday Night Lights, gets an invitation like this. ",
"My seat assignment is A3, in the front row. Celebrities get the front row. The fashion editors of Vogue and Women's Wear Daily and The New York Times get the front row. I am a FROW, not that I knew what the term meant before now, but I am fucking FROWING. Fifty-eight-year-old men who live in the nation's capital of fashion dreariness, Philadelphia, where wearing a striped tie with a striped shirt to a cocktail party causes Main Line doyennes to whisper \"the horror, the horror\" in between the third and fourth martinis and little nibbles on saltines with Velveeta served on silver trays, do not get the FROW.",
"But I am not here because of my particular journalistic qualifications. I am here as a private client of Gucci, one of five pampered and feted on an all-expenses-paid four-day trip to Milan and Florence. Business class on Alitalia Flight 605 from JFK to Malpensa on January 12. Private pickup to the Park Hyatt Milan, where the concierge has been clearly prepped before our arrival, calling me Mr. Bissinger with better pronunciation and far more enthusiasm than my friends. Gucci employees everywhere, like secret agents without the whole talking-wrist ritual. The fashion show with the presentation of the men's 2013-14 autumn/winter collection. A guests-only presentation at the Gucci showroom with champagne, way too much champagne. A sumptuous dinner with an unrestricted view of the Duomo, which shimmered with golden light in the shadows of the chilly night. A fitting the next day for a made-to-measure suit and shoes and shirt at the Gucci store. On to Florence and the Four Seasons. The Gucci Museo for a private tour of the retailer's legacy and then dinner. Then, on the final day, Gucci Casellina, where I am shown trade secrets that will get me lowered permanently into the Arno if ever revealed. And let's not forget the gifts waiting in each hotel room: chocolates stamped with the iconic interlocking GG insignia, a crocodile credit card holder, a crocodile wallet, and a tie. ",
"There are other clients coveted and important to the retailer, who will also get the royal Gucci treatment. We five got lucky. We are Team Gucci, with representation from Argentina, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We are for the moment Gucci Olympians who have spent Olympian sums and will presumably spend Olympian sums during the week. ",
"I believe I qualify.",
"God, do I fucking qualify.",
"Before I left, I promised my wife I would be restrained. She is very concerned, because she knows what can happen. But inches from the runway, waiting for the smooth mannequin boys with surgically removed hips and buttocks swaying like sunglassed Gumbys with the newest designs from creative director Frida Giannini, I know the promise is useless.

"I have an addiction. It isn't drugs or gambling: I get to keep what I use after I use it. But there are similarities: the futile feeding of the bottomless beast and the unavoidable psychological implications, the immediate hit of the new that feels like an orgasm and the inevitable coming-down. ",
"It started three years ago. I have never fully revealed it, and am only revealing it now in the hopes that my confession will incite a remission and perhaps help others of similar compulsion. If all I buy is Gucci, I will be fine. It has taken a while to figure out what works and what doesn't work, but Gucci men's clothing best represents who I want to be and have become—rocker, edgy, tight, bad boy, hip, stylish, flamboyant, unafraid, raging against the conformity that submerges us into boredom and blandness and the sexless saggy sackcloths that most men walk around in like zombies without the cinematic excitement of engorging flesh. ",
"I own eighty-one leather jackets, seventy-five pairs of boots, forty-one pairs of leather pants, thirty-two pairs of haute couture jeans, ten evening jackets, and 115 pairs of leather gloves. Those who conclude from this that I have a leather fetish, an extreme leather fetish, get a grand prize of zero. And those who are familiar with my choices will sign affidavits attesting to the fact that I wear leather every day. The self-expression feels glorious, an indispensable part of me. As a stranger said after admiring my look in a Gucci burgundy jacquard velvet jacket and a Burberry black patent leather trench, \"You don't give a fuck.\"",
"I don't. I finally don't.",
"Some of the clothing is men's. Some is women's. I make no distinction. Men's fashion is catching up, with high-end retailers such as Gucci and Burberry and Versace finally honoring us. But women's fashion is still infinitely more interesting and has an unfair monopoly on feeling sexy, and if the clothing you wear makes you feel the way you want to feel, liberated and alive, then fucking wear it. The opposite, to repress yourself as I did for the first fifty-five years of my life, is the worst price of all to pay. The United States is a country that has raged against enlightenment since 1776; puritanism, the guiding lantern, has cast its withering judgment on anything outside the narrow societal mainstream. Think it's easy to be different in America? Try something as benign as wearing stretch leather leggings or knee-high boots if you are a man.",
"The most expensive leather jacket I own, a Gucci ostrich skin, cost $13,900. The most expensive evening jacket I own, also from Gucci, black napa leather with gold threading, cost $9,800. The most expensive leather pants, $5,600. The most expensive jeans, $2,500. The most expensive pair of boots, $2,600. The most expensive pair of gloves, $1,015. Gucci by far makes up the highest percentage of my collection. The Gucci brand has always held special power for me, ever since the 1960s, when the Gucci loafer with the horsebit hardware was the rage, and my father, who fancied himself as being anti-status when he secretly loved it, broke down and bought a pair. Followed by my mother's purchase of the famous Jackie O. shoulder bag. As a 13-year-old, I circled the old store on Fifth Avenue several times before getting up the courage to go in and buy a Gucci wallet covered  with the insignia.",
"I own forty-three pieces of Gucci—twelve leather jackets, six evening jackets, five pairs of pants, six pairs of boots, four shirts, seven pairs of gloves, and three scarves.

I also have had several pieces custom-made for me by an amazing designer named Carla Dawn Behrle, who specializes in leather; they're worth every penny and more, given her fastidiousness and attention to detail. I apologize to those letters of the alphabet I have not gotten to yet. Zara, don't give up hope. ",
"I keep meticulous track of my finances on my computer. Most of the categories of spending are under relative control. Except for the category of clothing, which goes on for nearly eight pages in very tiny type.",
"It wasn't until the preparation of this story that I actually took a detailed look at the items I have purchased from 2010 through 2012. I was afraid, quite candidly, although a total of a quarter of a million dollars would not have fazed me. ",

"I like turning around and seeing the poor lost souls in the gulag of the higher rows. I hope they hate me, chattering chipmunks trying to figure out who the fuck is this poseur, or however it's said in Fashion Italian. Then again, I don't see them dressed to kill, in an $8,000 Gucci pony-hair jacket that no one else in the U.S. has and wax-coated black jeans, shiny and sheeny and sizzling. ",
"I see the collection, and the pheromones of hot clothing defeat the part of the brain that rations rationality—there is the deliciousness of desire overcoming, shall we simply say, overdoing it. I have to have it. I don't have to have it. I need it. I don't need it. I can afford it. I can't afford it. It is the cycle familiar to anyone who fetishizes high fashion. Still looking around at the crowd, noticing across the runway at least twenty-five attendees from China, the Wild West for high fashion, I feel the insecure contradiction of pride and self-doubt. I look good. I do belong, but briefs from Jockey are taking away a little edge: At least no one can see them. Everything else I am wearing—the jacket, the pants, the scarf, the boots—has been chosen in careful consultation with my sales associate at the Gucci flagship store in New York, whom I think of as the Divine Stylist, except for the Jockey shorts. I went out on a limb and chose those all by myself: I should have gone with Calvin Klein or nothing at all. My God, what was I thinking? ",
"Before the trip, the Divine Stylist and I sent pictures back and forth to make sure everything coordinates. Given my worship of beautiful clothing, she has more impact on my life than anyone, with the exception of my therapist and my family. She has been my sartorial shrink, honing my style, putting all the components together. She knows what I like, even when I initially say I don't like it. Before I started shopping with her at Gucci, I could count on one finger the number of compliments I got from strangers on what I was wearing. Now I get dozens, 99 percent of them from women and gays and African-Americans who appreciate go-for-it style. No wonder male heterosexual whites are aimed toward obsolescence, boring the rest of us to death. ",
"One model goes up the runway as another model comes back down, with an intersection somewhere near the midpoint. It is tricky for the uninitiated, whether to look up the runway or down, whether to concentrate on one model or both. The music is on and loud, and a narrow band of lights flash on and off. The collection whizzes by in my first-time-FROW confusion, only little bits and pieces of what may be promising. ",
"Later that day, Team Gucci, as well as some other guests, are given a private preview of the collection at the Gucci showroom in Milan, months before it will actually hit the stores. Because these are runway pieces, some may never hit the stores. In the best tradition of a fashion model, I have changed for the event: I'm now wearing a pair of black jeans, below-the-knee black equestrian Gucci boots, and the Gucci evening jacket of leather and gold threading. Even the chief executive officer of Gucci, Patrizio di Marco, is impressed by my fashion daring. I'd never looked at the price tag for the evening jacket. I rarely do.",
"It is all part of the \"Mr. Big\" mentality, the waters parting when I walk into the New York store on Fifth Avenue and 56th, the smile of the normally very depressed security guard at the front who knows where I am heading, up the sleek stairs to the temple of the men's department on the second floor, an ooze of sensual darkness in the gauzy lights. The other sales associates know who I am; I hear reverent whispers of \"Mr. Bissinger.\" The Divine Stylist, born in Iran and given her wonderfully fiery temperament, would do a sushi on them if they gave any remote indication of encroachment. The clothes hang like fantastic sex toys, but at this point I no longer bother with that. I am taken to a space at the back, away from the scrum that buys sunglasses and sneakers with the GG logo. I sit on a couch and sip prosecco in a fluted glass while the Divine Stylist gathers up clothing she thinks I might like or items we have already discussed (she immediately texts me with a picture whenever something hot comes in). Much of the time I don't come into the store at all, and clothing is delivered to my home. \"You got two big boxes,\" my wife says. \"I'm going to send most of it  back,\" I say. ",
"She knows. I know.",
"Back in Italy, the Milan collection hangs from racks on all three sides of the room. It's like Indiana Jones finally finding the Holy Grail, even though it was only three days ago that I bought the pony-hair jacket. But I am trying to be logical and systematic, resisting impulse, carefully going down each row to get a sense of what I might like. I see a black leather biker jacket I know I must have, even though I already own roughly fifteen jackets of similar style. But the leather is unlike any I have ever touched—and trust me, I have touched a lot—butter rich, with that irresistible gleam that can light up any night. ",
"\"Done,\" I say to my chaperone for the trip, the area assistant manager for men's ready-to-wear at the Fifth Avenue store. She is the Perfect Shadow, smart and tasteful but never forcing an item of clothing upon me. The Perfect Shadow has been carefully briefed by the Divine Stylist about my tastes. I don't ask about the price of the motorcycle jacket. The needle is in.",
"I see a pair of tight equestrian-style pants that will go well with the jacket. Done. I see a twill evening jacket with tuxedo lapels, different from anything I have, cut short in the style of the collection. Done. I see two sweaters, one black and one brown, with beautiful handsewn patterns that will soften my usual hard edge. Done. But some restraint is settling in.",
"I see a crinkled leather jacket with a shearling collar. I try it once, then twice. It is growing on me, a sexy blend of masculine and feminine, but I beg off. The same with a coat made of Persian lamb's wool that is probably the most spectacular piece of the collection. I want it, but I am not wearing the right clothes to get any feel for it. (It isn't until I am back in Philadelphia that I buy it; it costs $22,500, a new Gucci record for me.)",
"Then I see a leather jacket of red burgundy with gold military buttons. It goes to the waist. I like it, but it isn't quite distinctive enough. Something is missing, until I muse to the Perfect Shadow how great it would look if it could be lengthened into a full leather coat just above the knee, almost duster-style. ",
"\"We can do that. I'll make sure we can do that.\" ",
"Nobody knows the price of the leather coat yet, since it falls in the custom-made category. I breathe in. I breathe out. It is too beautiful.",
"\"I'll take it.\"",
"The approximate amount I spent on the four-day trip is $51,000. That is equivalent to roughly a full year's tuition at my son's college, Kenyon. I think about that. The self-indulgence is obvious. But it is my money, and I have paid his tuition for four years so he will not be saddled with any loans when he graduates this spring. None of which is really the point, anyway: ",
"I can't resist for the very reason I can't resist. ",
"···",
"As any addict knows, impulsivity is the meal ticket of addiction. The more you do it, the more you do it. Mine coincided with the boom in online purchasing and increasingly sophisticated websites. Up until 2010 or thereabouts, there was a leather jacket here and a pair of leather pants there, a modest collection worn sporadically. My everyday style was basically the same as it had been growing up, khakis from J.Crew and blazers and shirts from Brooks Brothers and Hickey Freeman and Jos. A. Bank. There was a phase in my life in the mid-1980s, after a year at Harvard on a journalism fellowship, that I took to wearing bow ties. They perfectly suited me at the time for the way I felt, scholarly and cerebral. Despite obvious longing, I did not buy my first leather jacket until the mid-1990s when I was 40. ",
"If there was a precipitating event for drastic change, it took place in the late summer and fall of 2009 with the departure of two of the most precious people in my life. My wife, Lisa, left to take a job as an administrator at New York University Abu Dhabi. My youngest son went off to Kenyon. I no longer felt like much of a husband; the 7,000-mile distance from Philadelphia to the United Arab Emirates hardly lent itself to weekend pop-ins. I also lost the one element of my life that had always sustained me and been constant, the raising of my three children. I felt alone. I was alone. Life with anchors keeps you moored. Life without anchors keeps you adrift, which eventually leads to some kind of trouble. Add in a life of extreme repression, and explosion is inevitable. Or maybe it's implosion.",
"I am also a writer. I crave stimulation. I need it to create, to survive. Without it I feel dead, useless, overcome by the worst anxiety of all, nothingness, dead man walking. There was a time earlier in my life when I loved to write, the same feeling of orgasm that I now get with clothing. But in my mid-fifties the words were harder to find, the excuses to fuck around more pronounced, the anxiety multiplied that whatever I was working on would never reach the dizzying heights of Friday Night Lights. It had been my first book, written nearly twenty years earlier when I was 35—2 million copies sold, a film, a television series. ",
"I began to dread the process, nothing ever good enough, the thoughts in my brain never quite finding the page, the withering negativity that had always been my guidepost in life only more withering. I fucked around more and more—nasty guillotine rants on Twitter going after everything and everyone, Googling my name six or seven times a day, craving crumbs of attention.",
"Then I started looking at clothing, hot and beautiful and transformative, a new sense of self-expression that I finally had the courage to realize. I hated khaki pants. Clothing became the stimulation and attention I craved. ",
"I began to buy, as silly an understatement as somebody drinking a quart of vodka a day and insisting that he or she is not an alcoholic. Clothing became my shot glass, another round, Net-a-Porter. But too often hits wear off, and the laws of supply and demand for an addict are pretty simple: You replenish. And replenish. And replenish. You fool yourself at certain times into thinking that's it and you have quenched the beast. But the beast is never conquered, and you don't really want to conquer the beast anyway, until there is disaster. I wasn't mainlining heroin, just impossibly gorgeous leather jackets and coats and boots and gloves and evening jackets. I wasn't harming myself or anyone else. I was spending enormous amounts of money, but because I make a good living and received a generous inheritance from my parents, there was no threat of going broke. My wife and children never lacked for anything. Plus, I was a person of enormous willpower, and over and over I told myself that I could stop anytime I wanted. ",
"More delusion.",
"The ritual became the same: online bingeing timed to any mood, feeling anxious, feeling depressed, feeling flat, feeling excited, and desperately wanting another excitement hit. (I am on medication for mild bipolarity.) So utterly displaced, I increasingly felt that life, which is a process of drowning in minutiae, was even more of a process of drowning in minutiae. Clothing took me out of it. ",
"I went on favorite websites day and night—Gucci, Net-a-Porter, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Vince, Shopbop, ShopStyle, and, later on, Mr Porter and Moda Operandi. I purchased in the morning when I should have been writing, and it did ramp me up to help me write. I purchased in bed at night, happy that the melancholia of the day was over and I had somehow gotten through it and deserved a little extra. If there was an item that I had somehow warded off in the morning, I bought it. If something caught my eye, gave me the slightest rush, I hit the \"purchase now\" button. I bought with my cell phone while waiting to have lunch with someone, or dinner, or a drink. I bought while I was having lunch with someone, or dinner, or a drink, happy when they went to the bathroom so I could finish the transaction without interruption. ",
"I bought when sober and I bought when drunk. There was a stealth action in London on vacation with my family in 2011 while everyone else was asleep: I sat in a soft armchair in the hotel suite sinking like a ship, barely able to keep my eyelids open in the wash of too much food and too much wine, but still managed to hit enough correct characters on my laptop to buy a $4,525 Versace jacket from Moda Operandi. I forgot I had bought it when it came a few months later, a pretty good indicator that I did not need it. But I still kept it, and it still is seriously smoking, and none of you can fucking have it. I e-mailed my broker for money when the debt became too much, on some occasions lying about the reason for the fear of my habit being revealed. I said I needed the money for tuition, or taxes. I doubt he believed me unless I suddenly had six kids instead of three. I did finally say I had a \"personal problem\" without further elaboration. I never mentioned a word to any of my closest friends.",
"My most anticipated sound became the ringing of the doorbell. It meant the UPS man was here, or the FedEx man, or the DHL man, bringing the goods. ",
"For a period of roughly two and a half years, until my wife permanently returned home from Abu Dhabi, I received a package at least every other day and sometimes two or three or four. Because I ordered so much, I often forgot what was inside them. It added to the drama and the ritual: the slice of the Swiss Army knife down the spine of the cardboard box and then the quick cuts along each side, the greedy pulling out of the paper stuffing, the annoyance of having to unzip the inevitable garment bag because it took too much fucking time, and then holding the item aloft on its hanger with thrill and titillation.",
"The only clothing I ever tried on before buying it was from Gucci. But many of the online purchases were fantastic—the patent leather trench coat from Burberry, a cropped leather jacket from Versace, a brown leather jacket from Ralph Lauren, a studded leather jacket from Cavalli, boots from Jimmy Choo, leather gloves from Ines in Amsterdam and Madova in Florence. I bought dozens of stretch jeans and leather leggings and leather pants that sculpted my lower body the way I wanted, with no room for speculation. I bought dozens of leather gloves that actually did fit like a glove. I bought dozens of boots, some with a flat or low heel that any man can wear, some with five-inch heels that only a man with real balls could wear.",
"Lisa in general liked the rocker look. But there were times I was too outrageous for her taste, and she began to feel like she was living with a hoarder. The kids liked the flair, maybe, but there were times they seemed embarrassed, or simply stunned. My friends, particularly those from Philadelphia, were appalled and confused and amused. With the exception of Lisa, nobody had any real idea of the extent of my addiction.",
"Too many of the purchases were sheer compulsiveness multiplying into more compulsion like split atoms. I bought an orange leather motorcycle jacket and matching orange leather pants from Alexander McQueen that made me look, well, very, very orange. The same went for a blue ensemble that made me look, well, very, very blue. I bought dozens upon dozens of leather jackets—bolero-style, waist-length, above the knee, below the knee—in which the gradations of difference were microscopic. I bought a pair of knee-length Stuart Weitzman boots and then two weeks later bought the exact same pair because I had forgotten I bought the first pair. I bought at least a dozen items that cost over $5,000 each but did not fit, the hazard of online purchasing, since sizing by high-end retailers is often like Pin the Tail on the Donkey. I bought items I wore once, or never wore at all, the tags still hanging from the collar. Yet I returned very little: The more the closets in the house filled, the more discerning I became, the more expensive the items, the more I got off on what I had amassed.",
"···",
"It is day three of the trip. I am at the Gucci store in Milan on the bottom floor. I am going through book upon book of sample swaths to be fitted for a custom-made suit. I stop in the middle to take an espresso to sustain energy and regroup, like halftime at a football game. I settle on a pattern made partly of silk.",
"I stand in front of the three-way mirror wearing a mock-up and am fastidiously measured by one of Gucci's finest experts on tailoring. A second person assists him. Both of them step back for perspective. This is why Italians should run the world.",
"I am taken back to an earlier moment in my life when I stood in front of mirrors at Brooks Brothers on 44th and Madison in New York. I was a preadolescent, pimples and early pubic hair, looking at myself with mystery as I tried on the khakis my mother had selected: two sizes too big so they would last longer than a year, since much to her disappointment, I was still growing. Combined with the billowing Brooks Brothers button-down in style back then, I was all set to sail, with my clothes as the sail. It was the preppy look that most of my friends wore. I fit in because I did not have the courage not to fit in, and the look was only accentuated when I went to Andover, ready at that point to equip a three-masted schooner.",
"Even as a child, I was acutely aware of the sensation of sexiness, and lacking outlets—baseball cards did not do it—I associated that feeling with clothing. I so wanted that feeling. The '60s were a time when clothing became this act of self-expression. Instead, my desire was converted to contempt. I started to hate my knees, and tried to cover them up. I hated blue jeans. Which is why the closest emotion to hate is love.",
"I remained steadfast in my Brooks Brothers uniform, except for the time my father took me to a wholesale-clothing store. There was good quality at good prices, probably because there was no hint of ambience, just racks of clothes where size was a game of chance. But I felt like I was in a New Orleans whorehouse, colors and bright checks serving as my hookers. My dad bought me a sculpted jacket with an intricate pattern of orange and black, and a pair of pants in the same colors that fit tight. ",
"I was scared to wear them at Andover. But finally I did during a parade up Main Street on Memorial Day. I marched because of the anonymity it afforded, surrounded by a shield of other students and professors. I suddenly felt an erection in those pants, as wonderful as it was troubling, since observable blooming bulges never had any upside at prep school. But I experienced a sexual vitality I had never felt before in my life. ",
"I never wore them again.",
"···",
"In Milan I realize that my penchant for high fashion, leathered out in tight pants and jacket and gloves and tough-assed black boots with thick three-inch metal heels from New Rock in Spain, is a way of making up for lost time, sadly so much of it. My idol when I was growing up was Jim Morrison, not just because I so thoroughly enjoyed the nihilism of the lyrics, but the look, the black leather pants that clung to him like second skin and apparently did because he wore them for weeks at a time.",
"I began to seek sexual expression in the form of high fashion, men's because I liked the hardness and women's because I liked the sexiness. Blended together, it became a rocker look, particularly with the three skull rings on each hand to fit my usual dark mood. ",
"It is safe to assume that when someone buys more than half a million dollars of clothing in three years, it isn't simply beautiful clothing that he seeks. My wife and I realized several years ago that we had run our sexual course. It was on the surface a strange decision, since both of us were highly sexualized. And great lovers to each other. And she was absolutely beautiful. But the twin killers of menopause and boredom had set in, as they do in every marriage. And I had never been able to equate sex with intimacy. ",
"I had always been attracted to S&M, even at an early age, when I didn't know what it was. My mother wore leather gloves in springtime. My first teacher in kindergarten, who probably thought I was mentally challenged because I never spoke, also wore leather gloves, and every day as she left I would watch as she slowly put them on with the stretch and pull of the fingers. My eighth-grade math teacher wore stiletto black leather boots and black hair like Elvira and spoke in dismissive clips, and I adored her, even when she dropped test results into my lap with B- circled in red at the top. ",
"I did engage in a relationship with a dominatrix after the failure of my second marriage. I left the scene after two years. But I clearly missed it, the trappings of leather increasingly irresistible. I liked extreme feelings of restraint and taking pain. But I was also interested in everything.",
"My sexual appetites began to spin in all sorts of different directions. My wife and I talked about it at length. She was far more experienced than I was, and she did in high school what I longed to but could not because of the need to please others—get laid, smoke dope, go to Woodstock. Before she left for Abu Dhabi, she urged me to explore, not on the basis that we wanted some open marriage but because of her feeling that I owed it to myself, to both of us, because my unfulfilled desires, or at least what I thought might be my desires, were leading to the nastiness and the contempt toward a spouse that comes from frustration. ",
"That is when the purchase of clothing intensified beyond all measure. The clothes became icons of aphrodisiac, a way of substituting for the continued fear of being someone and something different from whom I was supposed to be. The eternally preppy boy in the button-down shirt. ",
"I never fit the traditional definition of a sexy male straight or gay—tall, ripped, six- packs within six-packs. I wanted the power that sex provides, all eyes wanting to fuck you and you knowing it, and both men's and women's clothing became my venue. ",
"I began to wonder about sex and sexuality and where exactly I fit in in the complex spectrum. I did go into the sexual unknown, and the clothing I began to wear routinely gave me the confidence to do it, to transcend the rigid definitions of sexuality and gender, just as I also know there were the requisite stereotypical snickers. ",
"Was I homosexual because so much of what I wore is associated with gays? I did experiment. And while I don't think it is my sexual being, I can tell you that gay men as a group are nicer, smarter, have a shitload more fun than straight whites. Was I veering toward becoming a dominant leather master in the S&M scene, the leather fetish an obvious influence in most of the clothing I purchased and in much of high fashion itself? I did experiment. Was I a closeted or maybe not so closeted transvestite? Tom Ford makeup is divine; the right foundation and cheek blush and eyeliner and lipstick can do wonders for the pallid complexion. Thigh-high boots add to any wardrobe, although walking on six-inch stilettos for hours is just a bitch and therefore confined to the privacy of my house, seen only by the UPS man, who at this point could not possibly be surprised by anything. But a dress or skirt just doesn't look good on me, and I can't ever do a thing with my hair. The look I was going for was more David Bowie androgynous. It  wasn't successful.",
" I also went to Hong Kong and Macao with some friends. We went to sex clubs, many, many sex clubs with many, many women. We became tired. Four days seemed like four years.",
"Maybe I'm strands of all of the above. Maybe I just like all the different hues that clothing can create, a way of living on the edge when, let's face it, most of us never come close. Maybe what I really am is an extreme narcissist. I love looking at myself in the mirror when I buy something new. I love the sexual rush to the degree that I wonder if it has become a replacement for actual sex. But just like fucking, the magic of new clothing wears off quickly, and you can't resist the cravings for new purchases.",
"···",
"All stories like this should and do end this way, the slaying of the beast.",
"Bullshit.",
"The beast is patient. It has time on its side because it knows it is only a matter of time. Feelings rise up, in my case compounded by both personal and professional turmoil. I am grappling with a marriage, my third, in which I have reached the conclusion I was never meant to live with anyone full-time because of my moods and compulsive habits. I also had decided to take a break from writing. I was offered a wonderful opportunity in radio, which I blew last December because of my flash temper and scary outbursts. I lasted less than six months.",
"Still, there has been progress. The thrill of what I own lasts more than a single fitting. I turn out every day in the rocker look that has become totally comfortable. During the Gucci trip a fellow invitee said I looked like \"Bon Jovi,\" a compliment that at this point in my life means more to me than any piece of writing. Both my wife and my therapist have refused to let me pass the beast off any longer as some temporary compulsion. I have agreed to go to meetings for sex addiction, since clothing and sex for me have become one. But I am only going to stem the addiction, not change the way clothing makes me feel depending on how I want to feel on any particular day. I am sometimes afraid, the beast nowhere near bottomed out, wetting its beckoning lips, knowing me better than I know myself. ",
"Team Gucci all went out together the final night of the trip. We started drinking at the Four Seasons bar. We made a dinner reservation for 9 p.m. We drank some more. We got there at eleven and drank some more. We decided to go to a dance club called Yab. I hadn't been to a dance club in thirty years. But I was revved up and decided to stay up all night, since the ride to the airport was at 5 a.m. I haven't stayed up all night partying in thirty-five years.",
"I was dressed in tight black faux-leather stretch pants, a black Gucci T-shirt, and a black leather Gucci jacket lined with shearling. I looked so hip that the owner of the club put us in the special VIP section overlooking the jammed dance floor. ",
"I ordered a bottle of Cristal. Another member of the party ordered a magnum of Veuve Clicquot. Then I ordered a bottle of Patrón tequila. At first we all took little shots out of little plastic cups carefully rimmed with salt. Tequila? That's no stinking way to drink tequila. I bit hard on a lime, licked down some salt, took a long pull straight from the bottle, and passed it along. We swigged like sailors, laughing, cheering, dancing, singing. I finished the bottle off. I beat the Argentinians, no small feat when it comes to partying. I did my country proud that night. I was proud. I felt alive. I was alive. I felt myself. I was myself. ",

			"contents": [
"Someone who cares will ask you how your day is. They want to know what you're doing; they want to know if something significant has happened in your life. You don't have to talk to them all the time, but when you do see them, they will want to know how you are. Not out of some sort of obligation, but because they genuinely want to know.",
"Someone who cares will tell you things. They'll tell you how ridiculous that parking ticket was; they'll tell you a joke they found hilarious. Some people share more than others, but someone who cares will tell you things that matter to them, no matter how small that thing is.",
"Someone who cares will listen. Now, there are times when they won't listen well. We all do that sometimes: we're distracted, or so excited we talk over each other. But a person who cares will listen to you regularly, because your opinions matter to them. The things you say make some sort of impact on them – your opinions make them think, or make them laugh. But in their way, whatever that way is, they will listen.",
"Someone who cares wants to see you. They like spending time with you. It's not hard to read the pleasure on their face in your company. Someone who doesn't care is ambivalent, or pays attention only when it suits their selfish purposes.",
"A person who cares about you will take time for you. Even if it's just a few times a year – that friend from your hometown, the one separated from you by an entire 2000 miles. When you're home, they will want to see you. They'll chat with you online, or maybe they'll call you. Sometimes weeks or months might pass, but when it counts, if in your darkest hour you need them, they will respond, and will do so gladly.",
"Someone who cares will not make you feel bad for taking up said time. Although they might be busy, so are you. They will want to spend the time on you because that is just what you do when you care for someone. They won't make you feel bad for asking to hang out, feel guilty that your time is less valuable than whatever else they are doing.",
"People are never perfect, so you will not always get along with the person who cares about you. Sometimes you will be frustrated, or feel ignored, or accidentally ignore them, or fight. Mistakes will be made, because hey, we're all human. But then time passes, and if you can, you rectify the situation. Because that's what you do with people who truly matter.",
"Sometimes a person who once cared for you stops caring. Maybe they wanted to end your relationship, be it romantic, platonic, or familial. Maybe you did something wrong, or distance separated you, or they changed as a person. Sometimes you bond with someone, or do something for them, or have a heart-to-heart, and they care for you once more. Caring is a fluid thing that can change over time. But there are also some people who never really cared for you, people who you know will never care for you, no matter what you do.",
"People who don't care will not text you back. If you make no effort to see them or talk to them, you know, deep down, they won't try. They will forget you if you stop trying. Because if a person doesn't care about you, they rarely think about you. They don't care about your opinions. Because if you care about someone, they exist in your mind. You think about them, you wonder about them, perhaps not all the time, but they are there.",
"If it's a boyfriend or girlfriend, someone who doesn't care about you will not try to make you come. They are so concentrated on their own pleasure that yours means nothing to them. When you're talking, they will not want to know how you are doing. I once decided to drive up to see an ex fling I hadn't seen for a year. He did not ask a single question about me, but just talked about himself. If a person doesn't care about you, they won't register your facial expressions. They won't try to smooth things over if things go wrong. They will never consider your feelings, but instead think only of their own.",
"A person who doesn't care about you is not necessarily a bad person. It's just that they are not attached to you. Maybe they have enough people in their life to care about. Maybe there are things about you they don't like that they have never mentioned.  Occasionally, they are just a selfish and uncaring person. Sometimes there is no real reason. But it is important to really think about the people who care about you and the people who don't. Because when you care for someone, you invest in them. What happens to them affects you, and their lack of care will hurt you. So cherish the people who care about you, and do not invest your time, and your heart, into people who do not."

"In my work helping women build successful, fulfilling careers, I started to see something quite troubling. Women who had been high achievers in school-good students who earned good grades-were finding that the very skills that served them well in school were holding them back in their careers. \"Good student skills\" looked very similar to \"good girl\" behavior patterns, and being stuck in \"good girl\" mode was preventing women from leading, innovating, and having knock-the-ball-out-of-the-park careers. ",
"Success at work demands different competencies than success at school, and many women aren't aware that they need to shift their approach. Here are five \"good student skills\" that fail us in our careers, and the new, corresponding skills you need to thrive in your career. Are you stuck in any of these areas?",
"Prepare, prepare, prepare: Improvise. In school, students are told again and again to study hard –- to prepare for the test, read the assignment before the teacher asks about it in class, start early writing that research paper. Many students graduate believing, understandably, that preparation is the foundation for success. This can lead us to get stuck in a kind of \"preparation comfort zone\" where we only feel secure when we've had a lot of time to prepare for any major assignment at work. In our careers, we are called upon to improvise and think on our feet. We have to make decisions when we feel inadequately prepared, when we feel like the information and time needed just wasn't available. Practice taking action even when you feel imperfectly prepared, and get as good at improvisation as you are at preparation.",
"Just do good work: Do good work and make it visible. In school, if you did great work, you usually got a good grade. At work, many women continue to take this approach: I'll just do great work, and it will get noticed. I'll get the gold stars on my review, the promotion, the bonus. But in our careers, doing great work isn't enough. We've got to do good work and make sure people know about it. This can be an uncomfortable stretch for women, because we don't want to come off as arrogant or as taking credit away from others. Get comfortable owning your accomplishments and talking about them -- gracefully -- with bosses and colleagues.",
"Adapt to the authority figures: Influence the authority figures. In school, every new class brought with it a new authority figure who had unique rules, requirements and preferences. It's all too easy for students to conclude that the No. 1 skill they need is the skill of figuring out what the teacher wants and providing it. With that background, we enter into our careers looking to figure out and provide what each new boss wants. However, to become a valued contributor, we can't just give the authority figures what they want. We have to enhance their effectiveness by contributing our own unique ideas. This means we need to learn how to challenge and effectively influence authority. How can you influence your boss' views if you think there is a major opportunity she's just not seeing? How can you influence the management at your company to manage their people in a more productive way? It's time to add influencing authority to your skill set.",
"Look outside yourself for the answer: Draw on what's within you. School taught you how to absorb external information (from a book or a teacher's lesson) and then regurgitate that information back out. Yet as you move to more and more senior levels in your career, you'll need to turn your focus inward and see what you can bring forth from within -- whether it's your personal strengths like your problem-solving or communication genius, or specific business ideas that could make a difference at your organization. It's time to retrain your brain: The value you bring doesn't just come from the information you've mastered. It comes from who you are.",
"Follow a linear path: Follow your own unique path. Last but not least, most important subjects in school were organized in a very linear way. Take Spanish 1, then Spanish 2. Take introductory economics, then intermediate economics, then advanced. Twenty years of that training can leave us looking for a straight ladder to climb in our careers. Yet most women find their career aspirations don't match that ladder. Be open to unexpected career moves, steps off the linear path, and leveraging your past professional experiences in creative ways.",

			"headline": "In essence, the job of the strategist is to understand and cope with competition. Often, however, managers define competition too narrowly, as if it occurred only among today's direct competitors.",
			"contents": [
"Editor's Note: In 1979, Harvard Business Review published \"How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy\" by a young economist and associate professor, Michael E. Porter. It was his first HBR article, and it started a revolution in the strategy field. In subsequent decades, Porter has brought his signature economic rigor to the study of competitive strategy for corporations, regions, nations, and, more recently, health care and philanthropy. \"Porter's five forces\" have shaped a generation of academic research and business practice. With prodding and assistance from Harvard Business School Professor Jan Rivkin and longtime colleague Joan Magretta, Porter here reaffirms, updates, and extends the classic work. He also addresses common misunderstandings, provides practical guidance for users of the framework, and offers a deeper view of its implications for strategy today.",
"In essence, the job of the strategist is to understand and cope with competition. Often, however, managers define competition too narrowly, as if it occurred only among today's direct competitors. Yet competition for profits goes beyond established industry rivals to include four other competitive forces as well: customers, suppliers, potential entrants, and substitute products. The extended rivalry that results from all five forces defines an industry's structure and shapes the nature of competitive interaction within an industry.",
"As different from one another as industries might appear on the surface, the underlying drivers of profitability are the same. The global auto industry, for instance, appears to have nothing in common with the worldwide market for art masterpieces or the heavily regulated health-care delivery industry in Europe. But to understand industry competition and profitability in each of those three cases, one must analyze the industry's underlying structure in terms of the five forces. (See the exhibit \"The Five Forces That Shape Industry Competition.\")",
"If the forces are intense, as they are in such industries as airlines, textiles, and hotels, almost no company earns attractive returns on investment. If the forces are benign, as they are in industries such as software, soft drinks, and toiletries, many companies are profitable. Industry structure drives competition and profitability, not whether an industry produces a product or service, is emerging or mature, high tech or low tech, regulated or unregulated. While a myriad of factors can affect industry profitability in the short run—including the weather and the business cycle—industry structure, manifested in the competitive forces, sets industry profitability in the medium and long run. (See the exhibit \"Differences in Industry Profitability.\")",
"Understanding the competitive forces, and their underlying causes, reveals the roots of an industry's current profitability while providing a framework for anticipating and influencing competition (and profitability) over time. A healthy industry structure should be as much a competitive concern to strategists as their company's own position. Understanding industry structure is also essential to effective strategic positioning. As we will see, defending against the competitive forces and shaping them in a company's favor are crucial to strategy.",
"Forces That Shape Competition",
"The configuration of the five forces differs by industry. In the market for commercial aircraft, fierce rivalry between dominant producers Airbus and Boeing and the bargaining power of the airlines that place huge orders for aircraft are strong, while the threat of entry, the threat of substitutes, and the power of suppliers are more benign. In the movie theater industry, the proliferation of substitute forms of entertainment and the power of the movie producers and distributors who supply movies, the critical input, are important.",
"The strongest competitive force or forces determine the profitability of an industry and become the most important to strategy formulation. The most salient force, however, is not always obvious.",
"For example, even though rivalry is often fierce in commodity industries, it may not be the factor limiting profitability. Low returns in the photographic film industry, for instance, are the result of a superior substitute product—as Kodak and Fuji, the world's leading producers of photographic film, learned with the advent of digital photography. In such a situation, coping with the substitute product becomes the number one strategic priority.",
"Industry structure grows out of a set of economic and technical characteristics that determine the strength of each competitive force. We will examine these drivers in the pages that follow, taking the perspective of an incumbent, or a company already present in the industry. The analysis can be readily extended to understand the challenges facing a potential entrant."

			"title": "Why we behave—and decide—the way we do",
			"headline": "Organizational ailments, such as too much complexity, often interfere with good business decision making and execution.",
			"contents": [
"Organizational ailments, such as too much complexity, often interfere with good business decision making and execution. But they aren't the only source of trouble. Even in the best of circumstances, people must ultimately make and execute decisions, and we human beings are even more complicated than a tangled org chart or a messy decision process. We are prisoners of emotions, habits and biases. We choose A rather than B for reasons that we often don't understand. These pitfalls can ensnare individuals who are making decisions; they can also cause groups to go astray.",
"The good news is that psychologists and behavioral economists have been studying why people decide the way they do. In this article we'll look at individual behaviors, highlighting just four of the many obstacles that these scholars have identified. If you're aware of the traps, you are far less likely to be snared by them—and your decisions and actions will be that much better.",
"1. Fairness. It's a familiar story, known to behavioral economists as a version of the \"ultimatum game.\" A bored rich lady sits between two strangers—call them Robert and Juliette—on a plane. For entertainment, she offers to give Robert $10,000, with the proviso that he must make a one-time binding offer to give some of it to Juliette. If Juliette accepts Robert's proposed split, they divide the money accordingly. If she rejects it, the rich lady keeps her money, and Robert and Juliette get nothing.",
"So how much does Robert offer? In theory, he could offer Juliette only $10. A rational person would accept it because it was, after all, free money. In practice—and the experiment has been conducted repeatedly—people in the Juliette role regularly reject any offer that they deem unfair. A powerful moral principle, fairness, plays a big role in decision making, often stronger even than self-interest.",
"You can see this phenomenon in business as well: any decision that people regard as unfair, such as paying bonuses to executives while laying off lower-level employees, is likely to trigger a sharp reaction.",
"2. Confirmation bias. This is a version of what psychologists sometimes call \"motivated reasoning\"—we seek out and believe information that confirms our opinions, while ignoring or downplaying information that contradicts them.",
"Many experiments have confirmed this tendency. A few years ago, for instance, Drew Westen and colleagues at Emory University in Atlanta recruited 15 Republicans and 15 Democrats and presented them with contradictory behaviors from the two major candidates in the 2004 US presidential election, along with statements designed to explain the contradictions. For example, George W. Bush once said he \"loved\" Enron CEO Ken Lay, but after Enron's collapse he was critical of the company and avoided any mention of Lay. The explanation was that he felt betrayed by Lay and was shocked to learn of Enron's corruption. Each set of partisans tended to believe the explanatory statements for their own candidate, while regarding the statements by the opposition candidate as inconsistent.",
"In big decisions, individuals can easily fall into confirmation bias, jeopardizing the possibility of reaching the best outcome.",
"3. Framing and anchoring. Every decision depends on information. The structure and reference points of that information shape how the decision maker receives and uses it. Chief executives contemplating an acquisition, for instance, often frame the question as \"Why should we do this deal?\" and then answer it by focusing on potential but often illusory synergies. If they frame it instead as \"How much should we be willing to pay?\" the decision can turn out quite differently.",
"Anchoring—using a predetermined reference point as the launch pad for a decision—is equally powerful. A few years ago, for instance, Wharton School professor Paul J. H. Schoemaker was studying bad loans at a bank in the southern US. He found that bank officers assessing a loan naturally began by determining its current rating and asking themselves whether they should upgrade or downgrade it. Because of the anchoring effect of the current rating, as a report on Schoemaker's work noted, downgrades tended to be incremental adjustments. So \"by the time a loan was classified as troubled, it could be too late to take remedial action.\"",
"4. Overconfidence. People everywhere tend to see their own abilities in an unrealistically positive light. Some 93% of US drivers famously say they are better than average. Countless sales managers regularly predict double-digit annual gains, especially in the out years, hence the prevalence of hockey-stick forecasts.",
"Overconfidence often leads to terrible decisions, and not just in business. Consider the invasion of Gallipoli in 1915, which British officers thought would be an easy victory. \"Let me bring my lads face to face with Turks in the open field,\" wrote Commander Sir Ian Hamilton in his diary. \"We must beat them every time because British volunteer soldiers are superior individuals to Anatolians, Syrians or Arabs....\" The British were decisively defeated at Gallipoli, notes Malcolm Gladwell in the New Yorker, partly because of such overconfidence.",
"Analyze any bad decision and you are likely to find more than one of these biases at work, each reinforcing the others. Consider the tragic 1986 decision to launch the space shuttle Challenger in spite of unusually cold weather. Confirmation bias? NASA determined that previous flights had been successful, even though the seals on the solid rocket booster showed unexplained signs of erosion. Overconfidence? Management estimated that the chances of shuttle failure were as little as 1 in 100,000—low enough, as the late physicist Richard Feynman pointed out, to \"imply that one could put up a shuttle every day for 300 years expecting to lose only one.\" As for framing, Jim Collins, in How the Mighty Fall, notes that the crucial go/no-go decision in the Challenger situation was framed as, \"Can you prove it's unsafe to launch?\" Reversing the framing—\"Can you prove it's safe to launch?\"—might have led to a different decision.",
"What to do about decision bias? It helps, of course, to be on the lookout for its sources, and to try to compensate accordingly. Organizations can also create robust decision processes that acknowledge and address the biases. They can frame questions in such a way as to pressure-test assumptions. They can explicitly assign the role of devil's advocate, or even create a \"red team, blue team\" debate so that both sides of a major issue are fully represented. Of course, the human brain is more complex than any organization, and people will doubtless continue to cling to their biases. But robust countermeasures can at least minimize the likelihood that biases will lead to poor decisions.",

"First, let me tell you that LOMS has been of great help.",
"It was interesting and very concise.",
"Thanks to it, I was able to get an offer from BCG and Oliver Wyman.",
"I really enjoyed meeting the consultants, but ultimately feel BCG is a better fit.",
"In any case, I have a question for you regarding Consulting vs. industry. I have been told that one year in consulting = 2 - 3 in industry.",
"How accurate is that in practice? If I leave a consulting firm, what's next?",
"I hear many people go into positions in strategy. But is there something else?",
"I imagine someone interested in product/marketing management is better off going into industry. Any thoughts?",
"My Reply:",
"First off, congratulations on your BCG and Oliver Wyman offers. I am glad my guidance has been helpful to you in this next step in your career.",
"Let me start by answering your question about career options after consulting.",
"The short answer is that you can pretty much do anything... literally.",
"So yes, I do think that 1 year in consulting is worth 2 - 3 years in industry... but more important than the years' ratio is the quality of those years.",
"In consulting, you work on very high level strategic issues, Board of Director level issues.",
"There are many, many, many people in industry who work 30 years and never work on a Board level issue. In my three years at McKinsey, I worked on close to a dozen such issues.",
"Board issues are very different than functional issues, which is the more common experience you see in industry.",
"So if someone works in industry for three years in marketing, they have three years of experience in marketing.  The experience in consulting is more akin to CEO in training-type experiences.",
"You are simply able to \"connect the dots\" between disparate functional issues that those in industry are simply unable to see.",
"For example, if a customer complains that customer service is lousy: Why is it lousy? Is it because the company hired the wrong CSRs (customer service representatives)? In which case, it's a Human Resources issue.",
"Or did the company hire the right people, but how they are being deployed is causing the complaints. In this case, the issue is a client services incorrect decision type problem.",
"Or are clients unhappy because your products stink?  Is that a design problem? A manufacturing problem? Or a problem involving sales and marketing over-selling and over-promising in their messages, causing the client to have unrealistic expectations?",
"Or are retail partners selling the product in such a way that is somehow incomplete? Thereby causing the end consumer a negative customer experience.",
"Given something as simple as a recurring customer service complaint, what is the actual problem?",
"A VP of Client Services with 20 years could not tell you the underlying cause of the problem.",
"They would tell you how many more people are needed to staff up to handle the complaints, but they are generally not cross-functionally and big picture oriented enough to \"see\" how the pieces of the puzzle (the different functions in the company) interconnect.",
"The VP of Human Resources could not either. They could tell you how to hire better CSRs, or implement a re-training program, but doing a cross-functional root cause analysis is not in their usual job description either.",
"Generally speaking, in many companies (perhaps Fortune 500 companies with strategic planning departments excluded) there is often one person who has this cross-functional and big picture perspective -- the person running the business.",
"Yet, in just 18 months of work in consulting, you quickly develop this skill, which is in extreme short supply in industry.",
"This allows you to tackle any role with this particular perspective in your tool bag.",
"Here are some examples of jobs and roles my friends took after 2 - 3 years at McKinsey.  Keep in mind my colleague group started at McKinsey after undergraduate, so you'll see some go to grad school.  The career choices for Associates after three years is similar in terms of industry (minus the grad school).",
"* Harvard or Stanford MBA",
"* Yale Law",
"* Started an internet company (two sold theirs for $80M+)",
"* Work for a LBO firm",
"* Help run a non-profit",
"* Work for a mid-size movie studio",
"* Become chief of staff for a CEO",
"* Work in product management",
"* Become a Chief Information Officer of a startup",
"* Work for a client and run a division of the client's company managing 300 employees",
"*Work in strategy or business development for a big company",
"* Become an independent film writer and producer",
"* Go get a PhD in Psychology",
"* Run their parent's family-owned small business",
"* Work for one of the major fashion designers in NYC",
"Here are where some of my friends from BCG, Bain, Mercer, etc... ended up working.",
"* Ran a part of gap.com",
"* A partner at a venture capital firm",
"* Partner at a private equity firm",
"* VP of Marketing for Ghiradelli Chocolates (after working in Brand Management at Clorox)",
"* Ran a product management group at Paypal",
"* Worked in finance at Pepsi, HBS, Brand manager at Oral-B",
"* In charge of global marketing launches for Gillette",
"The mix of industry and roles is constrained not by your skills, but by your preferences. You will notice the roles are really all over the place -- very much reflective of personal interests that any kind of restriction based on qualifications.",
"The only field I can think of where consulting is major negative is a highly creative field. One of my friends at McKinsey tried to break into Hollywood -- working for one of the big Hollywood agents.",
"He found that McKinsey on the resume was a liability.",
"If you went to work for a fashion designer on the design side, I think consulting would be a liability... a degree from the FIT - Fashion Institute of Technology (I think is the name) would be more credible.",
"Though I know several people who went to work for high-end designers on the business side, and the experience was very much valued.",
"Personally, I went down the startup route.  I started one of the first social networking companies in the world -- about five years before Facebook got started.  60,000 users in the first 60 days, no revenue model in sight, end of story.",
"I later became what is now known as Chief of Staff to the CEO of another startup company, stepped in as interim Chief Information Officer, helped the company go pubic writing parts of the SEC filing documents, and took on a permanent role as VP of Product Management.",
"Ran a $20M division of another publicly traded company while my wife went to Harvard to get her MBA, decided to focus on having kids. Ditched the career in software.",
"Started my current company, which over a few years of fumbling my wayaround in ecommerce, morphed into the consulting company that is it now.",
"Published four business books. Serve as an expert source for various media organizations - Fox, MSNBC, TIME magazine, the Wall Street Journal, Inc magazine, Entrepreneur, Forbes, etc...",
"Basically, I answer business questions for reporters in much the same fashion I answer your questions for you.",
"So that has been my career path. Lots of startups, technology, product management, product marketing and consulting (for small and mid-size companies).",
"One thing that is worth pointing out is that in the two companies where I worked as an executive, I was very consistently seen by many in the company as the likely future CEO of the company.",
"This was the case in large part because I could see how all the pieces of the company fit together, and others with deep functional experience did not have this breadth of perspective.",
"Though this did cause some resentment with some, due to my age only being in my mid 20's at the time.",
"So the value add of the consulting experience was that I could run my department or division effectively while being able to see how it fit into the whole... and I was one of the few, if not only, people in the company capable of troubleshooting a cross-functional issue. Nobody else had the breadth of experience to do it.",
"So my career trajectory as an employee in industry was equally as fast as my trajectory at McKinsey -- and I believe the latter enabled the former."

			"contents": [
"IN my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million — and I was angry because it wasn't big enough. I was 30 years old, had no children to raise, no debts to pay, no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted.",
"Eight years earlier, I'd walked onto the trading floor at Credit Suisse First Boston to begin my summer internship. I already knew I wanted to be rich, but when I started out I had a different idea about what wealth meant. I'd come to Wall Street after reading in the book \"Liar's Poker\" how Michael Lewis earned a $225,000 bonus after just two years of work on a trading floor. That seemed like a fortune. Every January and February, I think about that time, because these are the months when bonuses are decided and distributed, when fortunes are made.",
"I'd learned about the importance of being rich from my dad. He was a modern-day Willy Loman, a salesman with huge dreams that never seemed to materialize. \"Imagine what life will be like,\" he'd say, \"when I make a million dollars.\" While he dreamed of selling a screenplay, in reality he sold kitchen cabinets. And not that well. We sometimes lived paycheck to paycheck off my mom's nurse-practitioner salary.",
"Dad believed money would solve all his problems. At 22, so did I. When I walked onto that trading floor for the first time and saw the glowing flat-screen TVs, high-tech computer monitors and phone turrets with enough dials, knobs and buttons to make it seem like the cockpit of a fighter plane, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. It looked as if the traders were playing a video game inside a spaceship; if you won this video game, you became what I most wanted to be — rich.",
"IT was a miracle I'd made it to Wall Street at all. While I was competitive and ambitious — a wrestler at Columbia University — I was also a daily drinker and pot smoker and a regular user of cocaine, Ritalin and ecstasy. I had a propensity for self-destruction that had resulted in my getting suspended from Columbia for burglary, arrested twice and fired from an Internet company for fistfighting. I learned about rage from my dad, too. I can still see his red, contorted face as he charged toward me. I'd lied my way into the C.S.F.B. internship by omitting my transgressions from my résumé and was determined not to blow what seemed a final chance. The only thing as important to me as that internship was my girlfriend, a starter on the Columbia volleyball team. But even though I was in love with her, when I got drunk I'd sometimes end up with other women.",
"Three weeks into my internship she wisely dumped me. I don't like who you've become, she said. I couldn't blame her, but I was so devastated that I couldn't get out of bed. In desperation, I called a counselor whom I had reluctantly seen a few times before and asked for help.",
"She helped me see that I was using alcohol and drugs to blunt the powerlessness I felt as a kid and suggested I give them up. That began some of the hardest months of my life. Without the alcohol and drugs in my system, I felt like my chest had been cracked open, exposing my heart to air. The counselor said that my abuse of drugs and alcohol was a symptom of an underlying problem — a \"spiritual malady,\" she called it. C.S.F.B. didn't offer me a full-time job, and I returned, distraught, to Columbia for senior year.",
"After graduation, I got a job at Bank of America, by the grace of a managing director willing to take a chance on a kid who had called him every day for three weeks. With a year of sobriety under my belt, I was sharp, cleareyed and hard-working. At the end of my first year I was thrilled to receive a $40,000 bonus. For the first time in my life, I didn't have to check my balance before I withdrew money. But a week later, a trader who was only four years my senior got hired away by C.S.F.B. for $900,000. After my initial envious shock — his haul was 22 times the size of my bonus — I grew excited at how much money was available.",
"Over the next few years I worked like a maniac and began to move up the Wall Street ladder. I became a bond and credit default swap trader, one of the more lucrative roles in the business. Just four years after I started at Bank of America, Citibank offered me a \"1.75 by 2\" which means $1.75 million per year for two years, and I used it to get a promotion. I started dating a pretty blonde and rented a loft apartment on Bond Street for $6,000 a month.",
"I felt so important. At 25, I could go to any restaurant in Manhattan — Per Se, Le Bernardin — just by picking up the phone and calling one of my brokers, who ingratiate themselves to traders by entertaining with unlimited expense accounts. I could be second row at the Knicks-Lakers game just by hinting to a broker I might be interested in going. The satisfaction wasn't just about the money. It was about the power. Because of how smart and successful I was, it was someone else's job to make me happy.",
"Still, I was nagged by envy. On a trading desk everyone sits together, from interns to managing directors. When the guy next to you makes $10 million, $1 million or $2 million doesn't look so sweet. Nonetheless, I was thrilled with my progress.",
"My counselor didn't share my elation. She said I might be using money the same way I'd used drugs and alcohol — to make myself feel powerful — and that maybe it would benefit me to stop focusing on accumulating more and instead focus on healing my inner wound. \"Inner wound\"? I thought that was going a little far and went to work for a hedge fund.",
"Now, working elbow to elbow with billionaires, I was a giant fireball of greed. I'd think about how my colleagues could buy Micronesia if they wanted to, or become mayor of New York City. They didn't just have money; they had power — power beyond getting a table at Le Bernardin. Senators came to their offices. They were royalty.",
"I wanted a billion dollars. It's staggering to think that in the course of five years, I'd gone from being thrilled at my first bonus — $40,000 — to being disappointed when, my second year at the hedge fund, I was paid \"only\" $1.5 million.",
"But in the end, it was actually my absurdly wealthy bosses who helped me see the limitations of unlimited wealth. I was in a meeting with one of them, and a few other traders, and they were talking about the new hedge-fund regulations. Most everyone on Wall Street thought they were a bad idea. \"But isn't it better for the system as a whole?\" I asked. The room went quiet, and my boss shot me a withering look. I remember his saying, \"I don't have the brain capacity to think about the system as a whole. All I'm concerned with is how this affects our company.\"",
"I felt as if I'd been punched in the gut. He was afraid of losing money, despite all that he had.",
"From that moment on, I started to see Wall Street with new eyes. I noticed the vitriol that traders directed at the government for limiting bonuses after the crash. I heard the fury in their voices at the mention of higher taxes. These traders despised anything or anyone that threatened their bonuses. Ever see what a drug addict is like when he's used up his junk? He'll do anything — walk 20 miles in the snow, rob a grandma — to get a fix. Wall Street was like that. In the months before bonuses were handed out, the trading floor started to feel like a neighborhood in \"The Wire\" when the heroin runs out.",
"I'd always looked enviously at the people who earned more than I did; now, for the first time, I was embarrassed for them, and for me. I made in a single year more than my mom made her whole life. I knew that wasn't fair; that wasn't right. Yes, I was sharp, good with numbers. I had marketable talents. But in the end I didn't really do anything. I was a derivatives trader, and it occurred to me the world would hardly change at all if credit derivatives ceased to exist. Not so nurse practitioners. What had seemed normal now seemed deeply distorted.",
"I had recently finished Taylor Branch's three-volume series on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, and the image of the Freedom Riders stepping out of their bus into an infuriated mob had seared itself into my mind. I'd told myself that if I'd been alive in the '60s, I would have been on that bus.",
"But I was lying to myself. There were plenty of injustices out there — rampant poverty, swelling prison populations, a sexual-assault epidemic, an obesity crisis. Not only was I not helping to fix any problems in the world, but I was profiting from them. During the market crash in 2008, I'd made a ton of money by shorting the derivatives of risky companies. As the world crumbled, I profited. I'd seen the crash coming, but instead of trying to help the people it would hurt the most — people who didn't have a million dollars in the bank — I'd made money off it. I don't like who you've become, my girlfriend had said years earlier. She was right then, and she was still right. Only now, I didn't like who I'd become either.",
"Wealth addiction was described by the late sociologist and playwright Philip Slater in a 1980 book, but addiction researchers have paid the concept little attention. Like alcoholics driving drunk, wealth addiction imperils everyone. Wealth addicts are, more than anybody, specifically responsible for the ever widening rift that is tearing apart our once great country. Wealth addicts are responsible for the vast and toxic disparity between the rich and the poor and the annihilation of the middle class. Only a wealth addict would feel justified in receiving $14 million in compensation — including an $8.5 million bonus — as the McDonald's C.E.O., Don Thompson, did in 2012, while his company then published a brochure for its work force on how to survive on their low wages. Only a wealth addict would earn hundreds of millions as a hedge-fund manager, and then lobby to maintain a tax loophole that gave him a lower tax rate than his secretary.",
"DESPITE my realizations, it was incredibly difficult to leave. I was terrified of running out of money and of forgoing future bonuses. More than anything, I was afraid that five or 10 years down the road, I'd feel like an idiot for walking away from my one chance to be really important. What made it harder was that people thought I was crazy for thinking about leaving. In 2010, in a final paroxysm of my withering addiction, I demanded $8 million instead of $3.6 million. My bosses said they'd raise my bonus if I agreed to stay several more years. Instead, I walked away.",
"The first year was really hard. I went through what I can only describe as withdrawal — waking up at nights panicked about running out of money, scouring the headlines to see which of my old co-workers had gotten promoted. Over time it got easier — I started to realize that I had enough money, and if I needed to make more, I could. But my wealth addiction still hasn't gone completely away. Sometimes I still buy lottery tickets.",
"In the three years since I left, I've married, spoken in jails and juvenile detention centers about getting sober, taught a writing class to girls in the foster system, and started a nonprofit called Groceryships to help poor families struggling with obesity and food addiction. I am much happier. I feel as if I'm making a real contribution. And as time passes, the distortion lessens. I see Wall Street's mantra — \"We're smarter and work harder than everyone else, so we deserve all this money\" — for what it is: the rationalization of addicts. From a distance I can see what I couldn't see then — that Wall Street is a toxic culture that encourages the grandiosity of people who are desperately trying to feel powerful.",
"I was lucky. My experience with drugs and alcohol allowed me to recognize my pursuit of wealth as an addiction. The years of work I did with my counselor helped me heal the parts of myself that felt damaged and inadequate, so that I had enough of a core sense of self to walk away.",
"Dozens of different types of 12-step support groups — including Clutterers Anonymous and On-Line Gamers Anonymous — exist to help addicts of various types, yet there is no Wealth Addicts Anonymous. Why not? Because our culture supports and even lauds the addiction. Look at the magazine covers in any newsstand, plastered with the faces of celebrities and C.E.O.'s; the superrich are our cultural gods. I hope we all confront our part in enabling wealth addicts to exert so much influence over our country.",
"I generally think that if one is rich and believes they have \"enough,\" they are not a wealth addict. On Wall Street, in my experience, that sense of \"enough\" is rare. The money guy doing a job he complains about for yet another year so he can add $2 million to his $20 million bank account seems like an addict.",
"I recently got an email from a hedge-fund trader who said that though he was making millions every year, he felt trapped and empty, but couldn't summon the courage to leave. I believe there are others out there. Maybe we can form a group and confront our addiction together. And if you identify with what I've written, but are reticent to leave, then take a small step in the right direction. Let's create a fund, where everyone agrees to put, say, 25 percent of their annual bonuses into it, and we'll use that to help some of the people who actually need the money that we've been so rabidly chasing. Together, maybe we can make a real contribution to the world.",
"Sam Polk is a former hedge-fund trader and the founder of the nonprofit Groceryships."

			"contents": [
"In medical school these days, a decent amount of time is devoted to the ethical issues around end-of-life care. I'm a hopeful future neonatologist, so the relevance of the topic to the perinatal period is abundantly clear. We can conjure up images of the 23-week micropreemie lying in an isolette, tiny chest jiggling on high-frequency mechanical ventilation, delicate features overwhelmed by lines and tubes, miniature wrinkled fingers stroked by parents' gargantuan hands. We ask: What kind of suffering is this baby experiencing? What kind of quality of life will he or she have? But what we don't talk about much in medical school, or anywhere else for that matter, is the idea of end-of-life care before independent life has even begun.",
"The day of our anatomy scan was the last day of my third year of medical school. I was 19-weeks pregnant, and we were so excited to have a sibling for our 2-year-old daughter. Chatting with my ultrasound tech as she squeezed the warm jelly onto my abdomen to get started, I asked her what she did when she found something terribly wrong with the fetus—did she tell the parents that she was seeing a problem, or did she leave it to the maternal-fetal medicine doctor to come in and break the news?",
"When the doctor came in and started talking—\"obstructive uropathy,\" \"distal urethra appears to be involved,\" \"very echogenic kidneys,\" \"massive bladder dilation,\" \"concerned about the baby's lung development\"—I could feel the exam table shake underneath me as I heaved and sobbed. As she scanned, I could see our son up there on the high-definition wall-mounted monitor in stark black and white, bouncing up and down each time I cried.",
"After the ultrasound, we spent the afternoon talking to the maternal-fetal medicine doctors, along with the genetic counselor who is always called in after parents receive an unexpected fetal diagnosis. Our baby had what is called a bladder outlet obstruction, meaning that the urine that was being stored in his bladder was unable to exit. The bladder fills and fills with urine, until it backs up all the way to the kidneys, where the urine is produced in the first place. Over time, this causes the kidneys to become massively distended, eventually resulting in irreversible damage.",
"The amniotic fluid surrounding a fetus is made up of urine produced by the fetal kidneys. Fetal lung development depends on having appropriate amniotic fluid levels, particularly during certain critical periods of lung development in the second trimester. When the kidneys are damaged or the bladder is obstructed, lung development can be irreversibly halted.",
"As with most of medicine, prenatal diagnosis is a combination of art and science. There are ways to visualize, quantify, and predict kidney and lung function prenatally, but all of these data points have their limits. You can see kidney damage on the ultrasound a few ways, such as by how bright the kidneys appear (their \"echogenicity\") and how distended they are, and by how much amniotic fluid there is surrounding the fetus. Lung development is trickier, though predictions can be made based on the level of kidney damage, the size of the lungs on the ultrasound or other imaging modalities, and the amniotic fluid status.",
"Our conversations that afternoon narrowed in quickly on prognosis. For our baby, there was a fairly wide range of possibilities. The essential facts were that he had extremely severe damage to both of his kidneys, to his bladder, and to his urethra, which drains the urine from the bladder. Because of his gestational age, it was a near certainty that his lung development had been seriously compromised. It was possible that he would be stillborn, meaning that he would die in utero at some point during the pregnancy or during labor and delivery. It was possible that I would go into preterm labor with him, and it was possible that the pregnancy would go all the way to term.",
"At birth, he could have breathed spontaneously or not at all. He probably would have needed at least some assistance with breathing, and given the severity of the damage, he most likely would have required mechanical ventilation, if we chose that route. Would his kidneys be functional? Would they be able to produce some urine, or none, or so much that his body would dump all its fluid and essential salts and so on? If he survived at birth but his kidneys failed, would he be a candidate for dialysis? For a kidney transplant? What does it mean to have an infant on dialysis? On dialysis and mechanical ventilation? A toddler on the transplant list? We barely even talked about the minor concerns, like the club foot seen on ultrasound, an expected complication from physical compression of fetuses with low amniotic fluid.",
"We could have chosen to speak with pediatric subspecialists from neonatology, nephrology, urology, and/or palliative care to talk about options for his care, both prenatally and after birth, though based on the severity of his condition, it was clear that he would not be a likely candidate for some of the prenatal interventions that can be effective, or at least ameliorative, in certain situations. Because of my familiarity with what many of the different therapeutic and palliative care options entailed—medically, ethically, personally—it was clear to me that what we were dealing with was choosing an end-of-life care plan for our son. And because my husband and I believe more in evidence than in miracles, we knew that the appropriate time to implement that plan was now. We did not explicitly consider the potentially tremendous cost of pursuing aggressive treatment or the psychological impact on our daughter and our family of continuing a pregnancy with what would end up being, one way or another, a dying child, but in retrospect those concerns were implicit in our decision-making.",
"It was a Friday afternoon, and we scheduled the dilation and evacuation for Monday morning. It was surreal to exist in the world that weekend in such a liminal state, to walk around feeling our baby kick his little legs and flip around, knowing that after Monday I would never feel him again. I woke every hour those nights, nauseated and heavy-chested, knowing that this little person who was here with me would soon be gone. Our daughter understood only that the little baby in Mommy's tummy was very sick.",
"I have since given birth to another healthy daughter, who could not have been born had we not chosen to end our son's life when we did. Until I was holding her in my arms, wet and pink and screaming and healthy, I felt an underlying sense of grief and anxiety, which no amount of ultrasonographic proof of her perfect anatomy, nor well-meaning but utterly glib comments—\"It'll be fine! So-and-so had a miscarriage at seven weeks and now has a healthy 4-month-old!\"—could quell. Even now, watching our daughter gleefully smear avocado all over her face and hair, grinning her joyful, toothy, lopsided grin, I think about our son. I wonder if we gave up on him. I wonder if we should have stayed the course and become the neonatal intensive care unit parents I see sitting up groggily on the makeshift bed as the team of residents bursts into the room for rounds before the sun is up, the parents' new lives playing out against a soundtrack of beeping monitors, pump alarms, and ventilators playing their strange, honking melody. I wonder if we made the right decision for him, and I wish that his brief existence didn't feel so invisible.",
"My story is not unique—I am part of a group of 20-odd other mothers who have also terminated pregnancies for medical reasons, and many of us have shared remarkably similar reflections and perspectives—and yet there is not an easy language for situations like ours. These types of late-term abortions for medical reasons occupy an uneasy place in the mainstream dialogue about abortion. Opponents of abortion may argue that terminating my pregnancy violated our baby's human rights and that if anything, we should have continued the pregnancy and opted for palliative care at birth. The more surprising and hurtful responses, however, have been from people like my staunchly pro-choice friend who told me that she was jarred by my use of the word son to describe our fetus, as though the moral basis for abortion depends on denying the fetus any semblance of humanity, no matter how close it is to the point of viability, no matter how the woman herself chooses to define her relationship to the fetus. I'm not sure I explicitly thought of our fetus as our son until the day of that ultrasound, but after entering a situation in which we had to consider medical decisions that included imagining our long-shot, best-case scenario as trying to get our little boy through a year or two of preschool before getting a kidney transplant and starting on lifelong immunosuppressive drug therapy, there was no way to think of him otherwise.",
"Why does any of this matter right now? In recent months, there has been high-profile legislation across the country seeking to ban abortion after 20 weeks or earlier. This is precisely the point at which many fetal anomalies are diagnosed in a pregnancy. My own state, Michigan, recently passed a bill prohibiting insurers from providing coverage for pregnancy termination, with no exceptions for circumstances like fetal anomalies or rape, unless women have purchased a special policy in advance, as though this is a situation anyone would anticipate and plan for. The rhetoric surrounding abortion focuses primarily on the question of when life begins—is the fetus a baby at six weeks? 12? 20?—and whether women have the right to make choices about their pregnant bodies. In our case, abortion was a parenting decision—the most important and powerful one I have yet to make. This might not be comfortable or convenient for the pro-choice narrative, but it's the truth. Some aspects of abortion might rightfully be best considered in the context of when life begins, but in situations like ours, the most salient fact was how and when life should end.",
"Sometimes I wish I had chosen to continue the pregnancy for purely selfish reasons. Had we not aborted, our son's birth would have been noted, his death would have been marked, and our deep and long-lasting grief would have been acknowledged and validated. Instead, we chose to give our baby what we felt was the most humane, comfortable, and loving end-of-life experience we felt we could facilitate, a cause that on its face is championed even in the most introductory ethics discussions among new medical students.",
"Because of the choice we made to end his life, our son never got the chance to gaze up at his parents, to see who it was that had been talking and singing to him all along. He never got the chance to fall asleep in our arms, bundled and cozy, pink lips and fuzzy hair like a duckling, smelling of milk and baby, the very best smell in the world. Neither, however, did he have to suffocate to death at birth, his small body gasping to fill his woefully hypoplastic lungs. He did not have to feel pain shooting throughout his abdomen, grossly distended with urinary ascites. He did not have to experience one minute away from the warmth and love of my body. We chose, instead, for him to be born straight into peace."

"PITTSBURGH, PA—Bernard Rothstein, an urban planner and traffic-flow modulation specialist with the Urban Redevelopment Authority, found himself stuck in rush-hour traffic of his own design for more than an hour Monday.",
"Rothstein contemplates traffic-flow problems.",
"\"This happens every weeknight,\" Rothstein said, inching through the Allegheny Center district he designed in 1987. \"When will I learn to avoid this part of town during rush hour?\"",
"The gridlock-bound Rothstein, who has worked in urban planning for 24 years, passed the time by devising possible modifications to his original design.",
"\"A direct path to I-279 and wider on-ramps would have helped, for starters,\" Rothstein said, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. \"Sure, a six-lane street wouldn't look as nice as that tree-lined square with the fountain—Jesus, lady! Move!—but with six lanes, I wouldn't be sitting here breathing fumes.\"",
"While attempting to nose his Lexus GS 300 into a line of honking cars, Rothstein brainstormed more solutions to his current predicament.",
"\"With more lanes, tourists wouldn't have to cut across commuter traffic to get from the area around the Buhl Planetarium and the Institute Of Popular Science down to the Three Rivers area to buy hot wings at those crappy jazz clubs,\" Rothstein said. \"You might have thought of that, genius. After all, you're the one who convinced them to re-zone it commercial. Moron.\"",
"Added Rothstein: \"Who wants a shopping area in—move your ass, blue Taurus! Come on! Who wants a shopping area in an access-limited waterway confluence, anyway? Oh, yeah: the genius Bernie Rothstein!\"",
"As Pittsburgh, America's steel capital, made the transition to high-tech and service industries in the 1980s, many thought its rusting, blighted urban landscape was obsolete. According to Rothstein, it was then that the Urban Redevelopment Authority, along with several private urban-planning firms, began the slow process of rethinking the city's roads, parks, and commercial and residential districts. Today, the city's designers are regularly lauded for their elegant, modern buildings and stuck in traffic of their own making for hours at a time.",
"Abandoning his plan to get on the interstate with a hasty U-turn, Rothstein explained that he was also part of the eight-person team that created Crawford Square, an 18-acre residential development on the eastern edge of downtown Pittsburgh.",
"\"Crawford Square is a pedestrian-oriented neighborhood with a large public recreation center, a three-mile jogging trail, and residents with a wide range of incomes,\" Rothstein said. \"Green space is great. It felt wonderful to turn four defunct foundries into a park-lined community with access to downtown. Would've been even better to turn it into a community lined with, say, 85 percent of the existing parkland and a few more goddamned dedicated turn lanes.\"",
"Hastily executing two left turns to re-enter the interstate on-ramp, Rothstein described the Three Rivers traffic hub. He said he considers the hub—with its long, flowing, elevated contours and broad, boulevard-lined access ways—an aesthetic triumph, as well as \"a complete bitch to navigate.\"",
"\"Medium-interval on-ramp traffic lights, my ass,\" Rothstein said. \"Very nice sweeping compound curves on the bridge thoroughfares, Bernie. They're very fluid—unlike the traffic stuck in them right now.\"",
"Rolling down a window and shaking a fist at the traffic ahead, Rothstein said: \"This is about that Route 28 thing, isn't it, God? If I promise to put in more HOV concessions, will you please get things moving here already?\"",
"A cell-phone call from Rothstein's wife Marjorie interrupted the angry tirade.",
"\"Well, I'm sorry it's taking so long, Bernie,\" Marjorie said. \"But remember, honey, that you're the one who said I-279 was a horrible scar gouged into the city for the sake of efficiency. It was your own enthusiasm for small, two- to eight-acre city parks that made Pittsburgh a nicer place to live and got you into this mess.\""

			"contents": [
"This week in The New Yorker we discovered much about Stanford University in a piece by Ken Auletta titled \"Get Rich U.\" For example, Stanford has produced many rich technology entrepreneurs—among both its professors and students. In fact, Stanford has been so successful at nurturing titans of business that it's causing some unease among certain faculty and school observers.",
"There's a glut of engineering-minded, money-hungry students, and perhaps not enough love of learning for learning's sake and the humanities.",
"As the story points out, Stanford's obsession with engineer-cum-entrepreneurs is by design. Frederick Terman, a Stanford professor, set out in the 1920s to unite local radio and electronics businessmen with Stanford's students. As a result, undergraduate students such as Bill Hewlett and David Packard found themselves visiting the San Francisco lab of Philo Farnsworth when he was in the process of inventing television.",
"In the years that followed, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), along with other electronics and technology companies, would place their headquarters on Stanford land. The arrangement helped Stanford compete against more established schools in the East for local talent and gave the local businessmen access to bright kids, research equipment, and new ideas.",
"Over the years, Stanford has perfected the art of helping its students and professors start businesses and share in the spoils of their work through favorable licensing deals. As a result, generation after generation—HP to Cisco (CSCO) to Sun Microsystems to Yahoo (YHOO) to Google (GOOG), Instagram, and Palantir—have emerged from the university.",
"If there's a light of hope in the U.S. economy, it emanates from Silicon Valley, and, my word, Stanford has done an awful lot to contribute to that fact.",
"That's a long way of saying Auletta may have been better served by asking why the nation's other elite universities have done such a poor job at breeding entrepreneurs. You can, of course, point to people from Harvard, Cornell, and other top schools that have created empires from scratch, but Stanford clearly challenges the combined efforts of these other schools on its own. (Frankly, I can't recall ever meeting a single startup founder from such places as Yale or Dartmouth.)",
"With China and India pumping out engineers by the tens of thousands, it's not so bad to have at least one school stateside that's a money-gushing, geek Mecca. In fact, Stanford's rivals should perhaps do some more thinking for thinking's sake around how they can mimic the Cardinal model."

"IPOs are wildly profitable deals for Wall Street investment banks, and they come with huge bragging rights.",
"So it's no surprise that the biggest Wall Street banks fought over the Facebook IPO for years.",
"The inside story of the Facebook showdown reveals a lot about the relative status of Wall Street banks in Silicon Valley these days, especially Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.",
"And it also reveals a lot about Facebook.",
"Facebook's in its IPO \"quiet period\" right now, and no one who knows anything is willing to talk publicly about it. This story is based on background interviews with more than a dozen Valley bankers, investors, and executives over the past few months, all of whom insisted on anonymity. (Some details from this story were also excerpted in this week's issue of New York Magazine, which you can read here.)",
"The story starts, as most Facebook stories do, with 27-year-old CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who used to tell colleagues he never wanted to go public...",
"* * *",
"In the Silicon Valley of the 1990s, not wanting to go public would have been heresy. Every tech startup in the Valley set its sights on an IPO, because going public meant getting pots of cash for the company, liquidity for shareholders, and a highly valued stock that you could use to scarf up other companies.",
"After the dotcom bust, however, the market for speculative IPOs evaporated, and many of the drawbacks of being public became clear:",
"You had to fight bad press and lawsuits whenever your stock dropped",
"You had to blow millions complying with SEC regulations",
"You had to persuade analysts to set estimates low so you could \"beat expectations\" each quarter even though you performed as expected",
"You had to explain your stock price—high or low—to your distracted employees, and,",
"You had to please impatient public-market investors, instead of focusing on creating great products and investing for the long haul.",
"In short, after the bust, many tech companies realized that being public was mostly a pain in the ass. And the private market soon created ways for companies to get the benefits of being public without going public—via large late-stage private investors or new marketplaces for private stock sales.",
"This was one reason Mark Zuckerberg didn't want to take Facebook public: He didn't need to. Facebook was able to get all the money and liquidity it wanted in the private market. The other reason was about control: Zuckerberg worried that going public might mean selling stock to shareholders who wanted Facebook's first priority to be its business rather than its product—a fate he had spent Facebook's entire history trying to avoid.",
"So Zuckerberg wasn't kidding when he told early Facebook employees that he wanted to stay private forever.",
"And if a byzantine SEC rule hadn't required Facebook to begin filing the same sort of financial disclosure as a private company as it would have as a public company, Zuckerberg probably would have postponed the deal even longer.",
"But that SEC rule—which forces companies to begin filing detailed documents when they have more than 500 shareholders—hit Facebook this spring. And if Facebook was going to go through all the hassles of being public, it might as well also get some of the benefits. Namely:",
"a highly liquid market for its stock, which would finally allow some of Facebook's large institutional investors to sell (Facebook employees have been dumping stock via the private market for years), and",
"a public currency with which to make acquisitions (it's difficult to use private stock to buy companies because the target company often thinks the stock is worth less than the buyer does).",
"Over the years, Zuckerberg had also become more comfortable with the idea that, thanks to the company's dual classes of stock, which gave him 57% voting control of Facebook with only a 28% financial stake, he would never have to give up control: Public shareholders could squawk about the way he ran the company, but they would have no legal way to force him to run it differently. Thus, as he saw it, he would never be forced to screw Facebook up.",
"So, last year, Zuckerberg finally became resigned to the idea of going public and pulled the trigger.",
"Which is to say, he delegated the bank-selection process to his Chief Financial Officer, David Ebersman, and went back to focusing on Facebook's product...",
"***",
"For the past couple of decades, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have ruled the tech IPO business, with one of the firms serving as lead manager on most of the hottest deals.",
"Goldman took Microsoft, Yahoo, and eBay public, for example. Morgan won Netscape and Google. Although other firms have picked off an occasional deal over the years, when it comes to tech banking, Goldman and Morgan remain in a class by themselves. To be sure, having Morgan or Goldman take you public is no guarantee of success—they've banked plenty of dogs. But going public without Morgan or Goldman means signaling that you weren't good enough for Morgan or Goldman. In other words, that your company is second-rate.",
"In the last few years, though, there has been a shift in the Morgan-Goldman power balance in the Valley. Specifically, until very recently, Morgan Stanley has won almost all of the hot IPOs.",
"Why?",
"Several factors, starting with the bankers involved.",
"Unlike other Wall Street businesses, corporate finance is still based on relationships: If you're raising money or buying or selling your company, you're hiring a person in addition to a firm.",
"And that person—the senior banker on your deal—is someone you're going to have to interact with every day for months. Getting your deal done will be a frustrating process, because things rarely go according to plan. And the banker who wooed you during the courting period will always be tempted to delegate you to peons while he or she rushes off to woo someone else.",
"So you'd better like your banker, and trust his or her judgment. And he or she had better listen carefully to you, understand your business, and return your emails and calls.",
"In IPOs and other financings, banks can serve as either \"lead managers\" or \"co-managers,\" with the former conferring vastly more cash and bragging rights. Within these categories, however, are other subtle but important distinctions. On Facebook, for example, three Wall Street banks were named \"joint lead manager,\" but only one bank truly truly won the deal: The so-called \"left lead.\" The other \"joint leads,\" meanwhile, have impressive titles, but they are lackeys consigned \"to the right.\"",
"The \"left\" and \"right\" designations are literal: They refer to the bank's relative positions on the cover of a company's IPO prospectus.",
"The first bank listed, whose name is on the left side of the page, is the company's primary banker. This bank manages the IPO process, runs the order book, and sets the IPO price. This bank also takes home the biggest bragging rights and largest share of the IPO payday. The names of the other lead banks on the IPO, meanwhile, appear to the right of the primary bank. Although these slots also confer huge bragging rights and fees, they are subordinate. In the eyes of other chest-pounding Wall Street bankers, being \"to the right\" means you lost:",
"Below the \"lead managers\" on the prospectus cover, meanwhile, are the co-managers, who get a smaller share of the IPO fees and bragging rights than the leads. On an IPO as big as Facebook's, being a co-manager is still highly lucrative, but it's miles from the prestige and money of being a lead.",
"Facebook's IPO is one of the biggest IPOs in history, so the glory and fees showered upon Facebook's lead banker were always going to be enormous.",
"If there has been one assignment that tech bankers and Morgan and Goldman wanted more than any other over the last few years, therefore, it has been to be selected by Facebook as the \"left lead.\"",
"***",
"The IPO that started Morgan Stanley's recent run of the tech table was LinkedIn, which went public in a blockbuster deal last spring. LinkedIn was all Morgan Stanley. Goldman wasn't even a co-lead. And LinkedIn's prestige and performance set Morgan Stanley up to win a whole string of big Internet deals that followed, including Pandora, Zynga, and Groupon,",
"The reason LinkedIn chose Morgan Stanley to lead its IPO, according to sources familiar with the decision, came down to the bankers involved and the way they wooed the company.",
"Morgan Stanley's lead Internet banker is a 46-year old California native named Michael Grimes. Grimes has been at Morgan Stanley since the early 1990s, when legendary Valley banker Frank Quattrone ran the firm's technology group. When Quattrone rocked the tech banking industry by defecting to a German bank in the late 1990s, Grimes stayed put. And he is now the co-head of Morgan Stanley's global technology group.",
"Grimes is variously described as \"a very strong banker,\" \"incredibly hard-working,\" \"honest, direct, and smart,\" \"weird,\" and \"a dork.\" He is considered weird, one VC says, because he \"plays video games until 5 in the morning.\" Grimes is also \"not a typical white-shoe banker.\" Instead of getting an MBA at Wharton or Harvard Business School, Grimes went to Berkeley and graduated with degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Such schooling would be a career liability at Morgan Stanley's headquarters in New York, but in Silicon Valley it's an asset. Most of the tech CEOs, board members, and investors that Grimes spends his life sucking up to are geeks, so it helps that he's also one.",
"(The executive who called Grimes a \"dork,\" meanwhile, tells this story as evidence: Once, many moons ago, when Grimes was a mid-level banker, he received a call from a client in the middle of a conference room in which more than a dozen lawyers, bankers, accountants, and executives were sitting around a table drafting a financing document. Instead of simply excusing himself from the room to take the call, this executive says, Grimes slid under the table with his cell phone, There, he murmured audibly to his client while the drafting session continued.)",
"Most of Grimes' biographical information is spelled out on his Wikipedia page, which is assiduously maintained. Some of Grimes' competitors snicker about this, suspecting Grimes of hiring a PR firm to game Wikipedia and buff up his image. The competitors also hold this rumored PR firm responsible for a series of pro-Grimes puff pieces that appeared in the country's most respected publications in the months before Facebook selected its underwriters—a press parade so obviously staged that one competitor described it as \"hysterical.\"",
"But whether or not Grimes professionally polishes his image, he has a good one to polish. His clients rave about him. And they hire Morgan Stanley to get him.",
"The same is not often said for a Goldman banker named Scott Stanford, who used to be Goldman's main Internet banker in the Valley. Stanford competed with Grimes for the LinkedIn IPO and several other key deals -- which Goldman lost.",
"Scott Stanford looks good on paper--Harvard, Harvard Business School--and he has his supporters. He cultivated a relationship with the brilliant Russian investor Yuri Milner of DST, who charged into Silicon Valley a few years ago and rocked the establishment by shoveling hundreds of millions of dollars into some of the hottest companies (including Facebook). He also seems to play better in New York, where one Internet executive describes him as \"perfectly smart,\" if not particularly impressive. But in the Valley, at least in some quarters, it's a different story.",
"In Valley tech-speak, the term \"UI\" is short for \"user interface\"—the part of a software program or gadget that you actually interact with. Scott Stanford's first challenge on LinkedIn, says one Valley executive familiar with LinkedIn's IPO decision process, is that \"his UI is off-putting.\"",
"Pressed for details, the executive mentioned Stanford's \"slicked-back hair.\" Morgan Stanley's Grimes also has \"UI issues,\" this executive says—\"he's a banker—he talks very fast\"—but Grimes is so substantive that you get past that. Stanford, meanwhile, \"flew at a high level\" and was \"very theoretical\" when describing LinkedIn's business, which I think is a gracious way of saying that he was a blowhard. In contrast, Grimes and Morgan Stanley team were \"very bright and very passionate about the business,\" diving deep into the product arcana.",
"In sucking up to LinkedIn before the IPO, Stanford and Goldman also made three key mistakes.",
"First, they entrusted the LinkedIn relationship to a relative peon: Stanford was merely the head of Goldman's Global Internet group, whereas Grimes was the head of Morgan's whole technology group. There's nothing that tells you about a firm's commitment to your company than the rank of the banker assigned to you.",
"Second, Stanford sucked up to the wrong guy: He schmoozed LinkedIn's founder and board member Reid Hoffman instead of the company's CEO Jeff Weiner and CFO Steve Sordello, both of whom played a big role in the decision.",
"Third, Goldman got there too late.",
"For more than a year leading up to LinkedIn's IPO, Michael Grimes and Morgan had been doing favors for LinkedIn's executives—analyzing parts of their business, showing them deals, helping them with their finance operations—all the while building a relationship.",
"Goldman, meanwhile, showed up right before the IPO and said, basically, \"Hi, we're Goldman—hire us.\"",
"Like most companies, LinkedIn held what is known as a \"bake-off\" before formally choosing its underwriters. Specifically, it invited bankers from several Wall Street firms to pitch its executives and board and make a case about why LinkedIn should choose their firms to manage the IPO.",
"Both Morgan and Goldman made strong pitches at the bake-off, a person who sat through them says. But Morgan included in its pitch-book a list of all the work Morgan had already done for LinkedIn, for free, while Scott Stanford was buttering up the wrong guy and Goldman's bigger hitters were off focused on other deals. And the relationship Morgan built through all that free work all but sealed the deal.",
"Not that Goldman gave up easily.",
"In its LinkedIn pitch, Goldman rolled out what would become its new secret weapon in the Internet IPO wars, a former Army Ranger and 1990s-era Internet analyst turned banker named Anthony Noto. Noto was Goldman's Internet analyst during the dotcom boom and bust. Like some of us, Noto made his share of lousy calls in the bubble, but unlike some of us, Noto survived them. Noto left Goldman in 2007 to become CFO of the NFL and then returned in 2010 as the co-head of Goldman's Technology, Telecom, and Media (TMT) group, as the equal partner of a Valley-based banker named George Lee.",
"When Noto first got back to Goldman, he was focused on media clients, and he watched helpless from New York as Goldman lost Internet deal after Internet deal. Then Noto began spending more time in the Valley. He rekindled his old relationships. He talked with venture capitalists and executives. And he discovered that part of Goldman's problem was the people on the ground.",
"So Noto clipped Scott Stanford's wings and brought in his own people.",
"(Stanford wasn't fired--he was just marginalized. Now, instead of calling on the hot companies, he gets to call on Yahoo. That's like a military general in the war theater being shipped off to Guam.)",
"Noto began taking over some of Goldman's Internet relationships himself.",
"And he quickly improved Goldman's reputation and business.",
"Unlike Michael Grimes and George Lee, Anthony Noto doesn't have much experience as a banker, but he has experience as a research analyst and CFO, which many Valley executives find equally valuable. They like that Noto can see things from their perspective—the company perspective—instead of just the banker perspective. And they like that he still has relationships with big institutional investors and can talk intelligently about how investors think about stocks.",
"Noto is described as \"relentless\"—he refuses to take no for an answer. But his persistence is somehow humble and endearing instead of annoying. Noto works his ass off to try to get new clients, executives say, and then he works his ass off to make them happy when he gets them. More importantly, like Grimes, Noto is passionate about his clients' technology products.",
"The best thing about Noto and Morgan Stanley's Grimes, one Valley CEO says, is that neither are what you normally think of as \"bankers.\" They work hard. They carry their own bags. They're eager to please. They display a humility that is often absent on Wall Street. \"After all the crap about bailouts and Wall Street,\" the CEO says, \"the bankers have been so beaten down and humbled that they want to provide great service.\"",
"To Valley executives, the return of Goldman Sachs to the tech IPO fray has been a welcome development: Now they can pit Morgan and Goldman against one another and make them both work harder to win deals. Or, like Facebook, they can hire both firms.",
"Anthony Noto arrived too late to save the LinkedIn deal for Goldman, but he has since helped Goldman turn its tech IPO business around. And in every deal since LinkedIn, Goldman has been regaining more ground. Goldman won a joint-lead role in the Zynga and Groupon IPOs last year, for example, and it won the recent Yelp IPO outright earlier this year. Most recently, Goldman has grabbed the lead spot for Glam Media and AutoTrader, both of which were big losses for Morgan Stanley and Grimes.",
"All that momentum, Goldman hoped, would put it in a good position to win Facebook's IPO. After all, Goldman had not made the same mistakes with Facebook that it had made with LinkedIn: The Goldman banker responsible for the Facebook relationship was not Scott Stanford but George Lee, the co-head of the firm's TMT group. And Lee had been rubbing Facebook's shoulders for years.",
"Lee is a very experienced technology banker. He's also a man with his own UI issue, at least from the Valley's geek perspective: \"He's cut from the traditional banker cloth,\" said one CEO, who added that to him all bankers are indistinguishable. And what is the traditional banker cloth? \"He has a perma-tan.\"",
"(These UI issues, by the way, go both ways. The prototypical tech entrepreneur is socially awkward, with \"bad hair\" and grooming habits, and runs around the Valley in sandals. As a result, they make the money guys nervous.)",
"When you're massaging a company, you want to do everything you can to put your face in front of its executives, in and out of the office. And, when it came to Facebook, George Lee went step for step with Michael Grimes.",
"In the fall of 2010, for example, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg staged a gala benefit in San Francisco for the Cambodian women's rights activist Somaly Mam. Events like this are a great way for bankers to demonstrate how much they care, and Morgan Stanley's Michael Grimes wasn't the only Facebook banker smart enough become a lead sponsor of the event.",
"The other lead sponsor was Goldman's George Lee.",
"\"Nobody cared more about Somaly Mam\" than Grimes and Lee, one Valley executive joked later.",
"So Goldman was in an excellent position to win the Facebook IPO. And over the next 18 months it pulled out all the stops, including flying Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein out to the Valley a couple of times to schmooze.",
"Alas, when it came to Facebook, Goldman had another problem...",
"***",
"Andrew Ross Sorkin, whose scoop blew up a deal.",
"On January 2, 2011, a startling article appeared in the New York Times. Written by the Times' star Wall Street reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin and a colleague, the article reported that Goldman Sachs had agreed to invest a staggering $450 million in Facebook at a price that valued Facebook at an equally staggering $50 billion.",
"Furthermore, Sorkin reported, Goldman was planning to offer its clients a chance to invest an additional $1.5 billion in Facebook at the same price via a private stock offering—in other words, Goldman was planning give clients access to a sweetheart pre-IPO deal of a super-hot company that everyone already assumed would ultimately go public at a spectacular price.",
"At first, this seemed a huge coup for Goldman. The firm was still struggling to overcome the horrendous publicity it had endured during the financial crisis. Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi had famously deemed Goldman a \"vampire squid\" and the name had gone viral. And Goldman had also recently had to pony up $550 million to settle a fraud claim brought by the SEC.",
"So the fact that Goldman had seduced the smoking-hot Facebook suddenly cast the firm in a lovely new light. By investing $450 million of its own money in the deal, moreover, the firm not only stood to make a monstrous pile of cash when Facebook eventually went public—it also appeared to have \"bought\" the IPO.",
"But then everything went to hell again.",
"Sorkin's article blindsided Goldman, making public a deal that was supposed to conducted in secret.",
"The SEC's rules around \"advertising\" private placements are strict: To protect investors from getting seduced by super-hyped stock offerings, the SEC prohibits brokerage firms like Goldman from contributing to any publicity around them.",
"Sorkin's article hadn't cited Goldman as a source for his story, but most observers assumed that Goldman had leaked it to him—for precisely the reason the SEC rule wanted to prevent: To whip up publicity and enthusiasm for the deal.",
"And, boy, did the article whip up publicity and enthusiasm for the deal.",
"After Sorkin's article appeared, Goldman hastily sent out an email to clients announcing the offering—and was immediately deluged with orders for the Facebook stock. Over the next week, the press went into a frenzy. Then, alarmingly, the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC had decided to look into the deal, to see if Goldman had violated its publicity rules.",
"After the SEC news broke, in a shocking move, Goldman suddenly announced that it was pulling the deal for its U.S. clients, for fear that the enormous publicity had violated the SEC's rules. Instead, Goldman said, it would place the entire block of Facebook stock with its international clients.",
"Well, you can't offer your best clients a sweetheart deal in a company like Facebook and then revoke the offer without pissing those clients off.",
"So Goldman's U.S. clients were pissed off.",
"And so was Facebook.",
"The botched deal was a major embarrassment for Goldman. But more damaging to the firm's chances of winning the Facebook IPO was the public animosity for Goldman that it stirred up again.",
"Facebook's executives didn't blame their Goldman bankers—led by George Lee—for the fiasco. But they were taken aback by the public hatred for Goldman.",
"The reaction at Facebook's headquarters, one observer says, was basically this:",
"\"Oh my god, we've gotten in bed with the vampire squid.\"",
"The blown private-placement, which should have cemented Goldman's hold on the IPO, ended up crippling the firm's chances of winning it. And because this deal played such a big role in the IPO decision, there's another tantalizing story about it that's worth sharing.",
"The story is that Goldman was not, in fact, the source of the leak to the New York Times—the leak that blew the cover off the private deal, triggered the SEC inquiry, and led to Goldman sustaining another huge blow to its reputation.",
"That story is that the leak came from JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley.",
"Before Facebook kicked off the Goldman investment and private-placement, this story goes, Facebook's CFO David Ebersman placed courtesy calls to the senior bankers at Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan to let them know what was going on. This is standard practice: Ebersman had relationships at these firms that he would have wanted to maintain. The news that Facebook was doing a huge deal with a competitor, meanwhile, would not have been well-received by these bankers, who would have wanted it themselves. So, the calls from Ebersman, presumably, would have left these bankers feeling jilted and pissed.",
"So then, the story continues, feeling spurned by Facebook and knowing the impact the deal news might have on Goldman if it got out, one of these JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley bankers called the New York Times's Sorkin and tipped him off.",
"Who was the tipster?",
"Maybe it was Jimmy Lee at JP Morgan, the story goes, the legendary head of the investment bank under Jamie Dimon (who also has a close relationship with Facebook). Maybe it was Morgan Stanley's Grimes, who is said to not be a gracious loser. Maybe it was Jamie Dimon himself.",
"For obvious reasons, this competitor-leak story is popular within Goldman Sachs. The idea that Goldman would be so ham-fisted as to blow up its own deal is mortifying to the firm, whose bankers need to be paragons of confidentiality and discretion.",
"Supporting the theory is the fact that it wouldn't have made sense for Goldman's bankers to intentionally leak news of the deal. Given the excitement around Facebook, Goldman would have needed no external publicity to get the deal done.",
"This \"Morgan nukes Goldman with a planted story\" story is compelling—a tale of bad-ass corporate sabotage in keeping with the knife-fight analogy that that one banker used to describe the competition for the Facebook deal.",
"But the word from within the New York Times is that it's not that simple.",
"Andrew Ross Sorkin pieced together his scoop from tidbits gathered from multiple sources, a Times staffer says. Goldman's competitors may have been among those sources, but it doesn't sound as though they planted the whole story in an attempt to sabotage the Goldman deal. More likely, it seems, some lower-level banker at Goldman let his excitement get the better of him, and told too many people about the deal.",
"Regardless, Goldman's competitors can't have been unhappy about the way things turned out.",
"***",
"When Facebook hired David Ebersman as CFO in 2009, it was with an eye toward the inevitable IPO. Ebersman would deal with Facebook's finances and Wall Street, neither of which Mark Zuckerberg had any interest in. And Sheryl Sandberg would continue to handle Facebook's business.",
"A former Wall Street analyst, Ebersman had worked for 15 years at biotech giant Genentech. Competition for the Facebook CFO slot was fierce, but after meeting Ebersman, Mark Zuckerberg knew he had found who he was looking for.",
"For starters, like Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Ebersman was young—39 at the time—which meant that he might be around for a while.",
"Second, he understood how important Facebook's culture and sense of mission were, because Genentech had shared the same qualities.",
"Third, prior to being promoted to CFO at Genentech, Ebersman had been in an operating role, so he wasn't just a numbers guy—rather, he knew how finance could serve the rest of the organization.",
"Fourth, like Sheryl Sandberg, Ebersman was already wealthy, so he wasn't just looking for a quick score from the IPO.",
"Ebersman also had other qualities that appealed to Facebook. He plays bass in a band called \"Feed Bomb,\" a gig that apparently gives him cred with Facebook's engineers. Colleagues describe him as smart and unflappable: \"In a sea of craziness, even the way he talks is cool. It always feels like there's a there's a quarter-second pause before he answers… because it feels like he's deliberating.\" A class-mate of Ebersman's from high-school describes him as having been \"serious, smart, great at math, emotionally detached, and conversationally challenged.\" In short, \"Zuckerbergian.\"",
"One of Ebersman's missions in the IPO process was to reduce its impact on the rest of the organization—which is to say, on Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. And by all accounts, Ebersman succeeded masterfully.",
"For two years, Ebersman built relationships with all the major Wall Street bankers and firms, tossing them small assignments to see how they handled them. He established a rule that all IPO-related discussions and lobbying by bankers had to go through him, and then he assigned one of his deputies, Cipora Herman, the job of handling them.",
"(Not that this stopped the banks from trying. In addition to Somaly Mam, other bankers tried every other door into Facebook they could think of, including sucking up to Sheryl Sandberg's spouse Dave Goldberg, a Valley CEO, in the hopes that he would say nice things to her about them.)",
"And when it came time for the IPO, Ebersman departed radically from Wall Street tradition.",
"Instead of asking Wall Street for advice on what to do, Ebersman told Wall Street what he wanted.",
"First, he drafted a complete IPO prospectus himself, with no help from Wall Street.",
"Then, instead of holding a \"bake-off\" like LinkedIn, he decided on his own which banks he wanted on the underwriting team, what roles they would play, and how much Facebook would pay them. Once he had made his decisions, he took them to Zuckerberg and Sandberg, who approved them.",
"And then, in February, a few days before Facebook filed its IPO prospectus with the SEC, Ebersman called the banks, told them what the deal was and what role he was offering them, and asked whether they wanted in.",
"Not surprisingly, they wanted in.",
"And, not surprisingly, Morgan Stanley won, and Goldman lost.",
"That wasn't startling—the winner was always expected to be Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs, and most people thought Morgan had the edge.",
"The shock was this:",
"Goldman was demoted to third in the Facebook-banker pecking order, behind JP Morgan.",
"JP Morgan is big in New York, but in the Valley, it's considered a second-tier firm. For Goldman to be pushed to the right of JP Morgan on the highest-profile tech IPO in history, therefore, was just more humiliation.",
"Nor could Goldman console itself with the knowledge that it would kill it on fees.",
"\"We knew the spread would be terrible,\" a Facebook banker from another firm moaned, referring to the percentage fee Facebook's banks would receive, \"and it is terrible.\"",
"Specifically, the \"spread\" on the Facebook deal will be about 1% of the total amount of money that Facebook will raise, as compared to the normal 7% fee on a small IPO.",
"Of course, 1% of a deal the size of Facebook's will still produce oceans of cash for the banks--$50 to $100 million, depending on how big the IPO ends up being. And if Facebook trades at a $100+ billion valuation after the offering, Goldman's huge investment in the company will earn have earned it $500+ million in a little more than a year. Its private-placement, meanwhile, will have earned it tens of millions more in fees, as well as a return of more than $1 billion for its international clients.",
"So it still doesn't suck to be Goldman, even when some clients still think of you as the Squid.",
"The story that echoed around Wall Street after the IPO news broke was that Morgan Stanley bankers were pounding their chests and bragging about how they had dazzled Facebook and won the deal.",
"That wasn't really true--if anyone \"won\" the Facebook deal, it was Facebook--but some celebration was certainly in order.",
"Another banker involved in the deal was decidedly more gracious.",
"\"However dazzling and indispensable we Wall Street guys think we are,\" he said, \"Facebook knew what they were doing.\""
