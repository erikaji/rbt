			"title": "How to Do What You Love",
			"headline": "To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly novel.",
			"contents": [
				"To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly novel. We've got it down to four words: \"Do what you love.\" But it's not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is complicated.",
				"The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.",
				"And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work.",
				"The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids. Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work. Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing. Much as we disliked school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.",
				"Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun. Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of them. Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing dodgeball? For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of kids instead of lying on a beach. You couldn't just do what you wanted.",
				"I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want. They may have to be made to work on certain things. But if we make kids work on dull stuff, it might be wise to tell them that tediousness is not the defining quality of work, and indeed that the reason they have to work on dull stuff now is so they can work on more interesting stuff later. [1]",
				"Once, when I was about 9 or 10, my father told me I could be whatever I wanted when I grew up, so long as I enjoyed it. I remember that precisely because it seemed so anomalous. It was like being told to use dry water. Whatever I thought he meant, I didn't think he meant work could literally be fun—fun like playing. It took me years to grasp that.",
				"Jobs",
				"By high school, the prospect of an actual job was on the horizon. Adults would sometimes come to speak to us about their work, or we would go to see them at work. It was always understood that they enjoyed what they did. In retrospect I think one may have: the private jet pilot. But I don't think the bank manager really did.",
				"The main reason they all acted as if they enjoyed their work was presumably the upper-middle class convention that you're supposed to. It would not merely be bad for your career to say that you despised your job, but a social faux-pas.",
				"Why is it conventional to pretend to like what you do? The first sentence of this essay explains that. If you have to like something to do it well, then the most successful people will all like what they do. That's where the upper-middle class tradition comes from. Just as houses all over America are full of chairs that are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of chairs designed 250 years ago for French kings, conventional attitudes about work are, without the owners even knowing it, nth-degree imitations of the attitudes of people who've done great things.",
				"What a recipe for alienation. By the time they reach an age to think about what they'd like to do, most kids have been thoroughly misled about the idea of loving one's work. School has trained them to regard work as an unpleasant duty. Having a job is said to be even more onerous than schoolwork. And yet all the adults claim to like what they do. You can't blame kids for thinking \"I am not like these people; I am not suited to this world.\"",
				"Actually they've been told three lies: the stuff they've been taught to regard as work in school is not real work; grownup work is not (necessarily) worse than schoolwork; and many of the adults around them are lying when they say they like what they do.",
				"The most dangerous liars can be the kids' own parents. If you take a boring job to give your family a high standard of living, as so many people do, you risk infecting your kids with the idea that work is boring. [2] Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so unselfish. A parent who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house. [3]",
				"It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living. Then the important question became not how to make money, but what to work on. Ideally these coincided, but some spectacular boundary cases (like Einstein in the patent office) proved they weren't identical.",
				"The definition of work was now to make some original contribution to the world, and in the process not to starve. But after the habit of so many years my idea of work still included a large component of pain. Work still seemed to require discipline, because only hard problems yielded grand results, and hard problems couldn't literally be fun. Surely one had to force oneself to work on them.",
				"If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to notice if you're doing it wrong. That about sums up my experience of graduate school.",
				"Bounds",
				"How much are you supposed to like what you do? Unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too early. You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige—or sheer inertia.",
				"Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this second. Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first.",
				"It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do. There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked that much. If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer? Honestly, no.",
				"But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.",
				"Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.",
				"As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure. You have to like what you do enough that the concept of \"spare time\" seems mistaken. Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working. You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up. Then you want to do something else—even something mindless. But you don't regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.",
				"I put the lower bound there for practical reasons. If your work is not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems with procrastination. You'll have to force yourself to work, and when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.",
				"To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire. You have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool. This doesn't mean you have to make something. If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least, wow, that's pretty cool. What there has to be is a test.",
				"So one thing that falls just short of the standard, I think, is reading books. Except for some books in math and the hard sciences, there's no test of how well you've read a book, and that's why merely reading books doesn't quite feel like work. You have to do something with what you've read to feel productive.",
				"I think the best test is one Gino Lee taught me: to try to do things that would make your friends say wow. But it probably wouldn't start to work properly till about age 22, because most people haven't had a big enough sample to pick friends from before then.",
				"Sirens",
				"What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends. You shouldn't worry about prestige. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world. When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know? [4]",
				"This is easy advice to give. It's hard to follow, especially when you're young. [5] Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.",
				"That's what leads people to try to write novels, for example. They like reading novels. They notice that people who write them win Nobel prizes. What could be more wonderful, they think, than to be a novelist? But liking the idea of being a novelist is not enough; you have to like the actual work of novel-writing if you're going to be good at it; you have to like making up elaborate lies.",
				"Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.",
				"Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious. If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. That's the recipe for getting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and so on. It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have had to make it prestigious.",
				"Similarly, if you admire two kinds of work equally, but one is more prestigious, you should probably choose the other. Your opinions about what's admirable are always going to be slightly influenced by prestige, so if the two seem equal to you, you probably have more genuine admiration for the less prestigious one.",
				"The other big force leading people astray is money. Money by itself is not that dangerous. When something pays well but is regarded with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal injury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it. That kind of work ends up being done by people who are \"just trying to make a living.\" (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say this.) The danger is when money is combined with prestige, as in, say, corporate law, or medicine. A comparatively safe and prosperous career with some automatic baseline prestige is dangerously tempting to someone young, who hasn't thought much about what they really like.",
				"The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it—even if they had to work at another job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers would do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?",
				"This test is especially helpful in deciding between different kinds of academic work, because fields vary greatly in this respect. Most good mathematicians would work on math even if there were no jobs as math professors, whereas in the departments at the other end of the spectrum, the availability of teaching jobs is the driver: people would rather be English professors than work in ad agencies, and publishing papers is the way you compete for such jobs. Math would happen without math departments, but it is the existence of English majors, and therefore jobs teaching them, that calls into being all those thousands of dreary papers about gender and identity in the novels of Conrad. No one does that kind of thing for fun.",
				"The advice of parents will tend to err on the side of money. It seems safe to say there are more undergrads who want to be novelists and whose parents want them to be doctors than who want to be doctors and whose parents want them to be novelists. The kids think their parents are \"materialistic.\" Not necessarily. All parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves, simply because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards. If your eight year old son decides to climb a tall tree, or your teenage daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a share in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets pregnant, you'll have to deal with the consequences.",
				"Discipline",
				"With such powerful forces leading us astray, it's not surprising we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on. Most people are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work = pain. Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige or money. How many even discover something they love to work on? A few hundred thousand, perhaps, out of billions.",
				"It's hard to find work you love; it must be, if so few do. So don't underestimate this task. And don't feel bad if you haven't succeeded yet. In fact, if you admit to yourself that you're discontented, you're a step ahead of most people, who are still in denial. If you're surrounded by colleagues who claim to enjoy work that you find contemptible, odds are they're lying to themselves. Not necessarily, but probably.",
				"Although doing great work takes less discipline than people think—because the way to do great work is to find something you like so much that you don't have to force yourself to do it—finding work you love does usually require discipline. Some people are lucky enough to know what they want to do when they're 12, and just glide along as if they were on railroad tracks. But this seems the exception. More often people who do great things have careers with the trajectory of a ping-pong ball. They go to school to study A, drop out and get a job doing B, and then become famous for C after taking it up on the side.",
				"Sometimes jumping from one sort of work to another is a sign of energy, and sometimes it's a sign of laziness. Are you dropping out, or boldly carving a new path? You often can't tell yourself. Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments early on, when they're trying to find their niche.",
				"Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest? One is to try to do a good job at whatever you're doing, even if you don't like it. Then at least you'll know you're not using dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy. Perhaps more importantly, you'll get into the habit of doing things well.",
				"Another test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you're actually writing.",
				"\"Always produce\" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. \"Always produce\" will discover your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.",
				"Of course, figuring out what you like to work on doesn't mean you get to work on it. That's a separate question. And if you're ambitious you have to keep them separate: you have to make a conscious effort to keep your ideas about what you want from being contaminated by what seems possible. [6]",
				"It's painful to keep them apart, because it's painful to observe the gap between them. So most people pre-emptively lower their expectations. For example, if you asked random people on the street if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most would say something like \"Oh, I can't draw.\" This is more a statement of intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try. Because the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far. But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years. And so to protect themselves people say \"I can't.\"",
				"Another related line you often hear is that not everyone can do work they love—that someone has to do the unpleasant jobs. Really? How do you make them? In the US the only mechanism for forcing people to do unpleasant jobs is the draft, and that hasn't been invoked for over 30 years. All we can do is encourage people to do unpleasant work, with money and prestige.",
				"If there's something people still won't do, it seems as if society just has to make do without. That's what happened with domestic servants. For millennia that was the canonical example of a job \"someone had to do.\" And yet in the mid twentieth century servants practically disappeared in rich countries, and the rich have just had to do without.",
				"So while there may be some things someone has to do, there's a good chance anyone saying that about any particular job is mistaken. Most unpleasant jobs would either get automated or go undone if no one were willing to do them.",
				"Two Routes",
				"There's another sense of \"not everyone can do work they love\" that's all too true, however. One has to make a living, and it's hard to get paid for doing work you love. There are two routes to that destination:",
				"The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don't.",
				"The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money to work on things you do.",
				"The organic route is more common. It happens naturally to anyone who does good work. A young architect has to take whatever work he can get, but if he does well he'll gradually be in a position to pick and choose among projects. The disadvantage of this route is that it's slow and uncertain. Even tenure is not real freedom.",
				"The two-job route has several variants depending on how long you work for money at a time. At one extreme is the \"day job,\" where you work regular hours at one job to make money, and work on what you love in your spare time. At the other extreme you work at something till you make enough not to have to work for money again.",
				"The two-job route is less common than the organic route, because it requires a deliberate choice. It's also more dangerous. Life tends to get more expensive as you get older, so it's easy to get sucked into working longer than you expected at the money job. Worse still, anything you work on changes you. If you work too long on tedious stuff, it will rot your brain. And the best paying jobs are most dangerous, because they require your full attention.",
				"The advantage of the two-job route is that it lets you jump over obstacles. The landscape of possible jobs isn't flat; there are walls of varying heights between different kinds of work. [7] The trick of maximizing the parts of your job that you like can get you from architecture to product design, but not, probably, to music. If you make money doing one thing and then work on another, you have more freedom of choice.",
				"Which route should you take? That depends on how sure you are of what you want to do, how good you are at taking orders, how much risk you can stand, and the odds that anyone will pay (in your lifetime) for what you want to do. If you're sure of the general area you want to work in and it's something people are likely to pay you for, then you should probably take the organic route. But if you don't know what you want to work on, or don't like to take orders, you may want to take the two-job route, if you can stand the risk.",
				"Don't decide too soon. Kids who know early what they want to do seem impressive, as if they got the answer to some math question before the other kids. They have an answer, certainly, but odds are it's wrong.",
				"A friend of mine who is a quite successful doctor complains constantly about her job. When people applying to medical school ask her for advice, she wants to shake them and yell \"Don't do it!\" (But she never does.) How did she get into this fix? In high school she already wanted to be a doctor. And she is so ambitious and determined that she overcame every obstacle along the way—including, unfortunately, not liking it.",
				"Now she has a life chosen for her by a high-school kid.",
				"When you're young, you're given the impression that you'll get enough information to make each choice before you need to make it. But this is certainly not so with work. When you're deciding what to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information. Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are like. At best you may have a couple internships, but not all jobs offer internships, and those that do don't teach you much more about the work than being a batboy teaches you about playing baseball.",
				"In the design of lives, as in the design of most other things, you get better results if you use flexible media. So unless you're fairly sure what you want to do, your best bet may be to choose a type of work that could turn into either an organic or two-job career. That was probably part of the reason I chose computers. You can be a professor, or make a lot of money, or morph it into any number of other kinds of work.",
				"It's also wise, early on, to seek jobs that let you do many different things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like. Conversely, the extreme version of the two-job route is dangerous because it teaches you so little about what you like. If you work hard at being a bond trader for ten years, thinking that you'll quit and write novels when you have enough money, what happens when you quit and then discover that you don't actually like writing novels?",
				"Most people would say, I'd take that problem. Give me a million dollars and I'll figure out what to do. But it's harder than it looks. Constraints give your life shape. Remove them and most people have no idea what to do: look at what happens to those who win lotteries or inherit money. Much as everyone thinks they want financial security, the happiest people are not those who have it, but those who like what they do. So a plan that promises freedom at the expense of knowing what to do with it may not be as good as it seems.",
				"Whichever route you take, expect a struggle. Finding work you love is very difficult. Most people fail. Even if you succeed, it's rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or forties. But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more likely to arrive at it. If you know you can love work, you're in the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're practically there."

			"headline": "In the 10 years since I graduated from college, I’ve had the same conversation hundreds of times.",
			"contents": [
				"In the 10 years since I graduated from college, I’ve had the same conversation hundreds of times:",
				"\"What are you doing now?\"",
				"\"I’m an engineer/a lawyer/a pharmacist/an analyst at [insert name of large bank here].\"",
				"\"Oh, cool!  Do you like it?\"",
				"[shrug] \"It’s work.\"",
				"Or maybe:",
				"\"Not really, but… I guess it’s okay for now….\"",
				"Or maybe just:",
				"\"No.\"",
				"I’ve had this conversation so many times that I feel like this problem is epidemic:  So many Asian Americans I know have great jobs.  So few of them enjoy their work.",
				"I’ve dubbed this the Asian American Quarter-Life Crisis: intelligent and hard-working twenty- and thirtysomethings in stable, well-paying jobs that they detest but don’t leave.",
				"If the conversation continues (and often it doesn’t, because the other person is depressed by it or just doesn’t want to talk about it), the reasons for staying in the job are sometimes predictable.  \"It pays the bills.\"  \"The economy is crap.\"  But what I hear most often is this: \"I don’t know what else I would do.\"",
				"***",
				"Working a job that you don’t like isn’t unique to Asian Americans, obviously — it’s a problem so common that complaining about it is cliche.  But I think this issue is especially pervasive in Asian American communities.  For one, Asian cultures tend to be risk-averse, to value knowing your place and not rocking the boat.  On top of that, our parents came to this country for the sake of financial security and stability, and they inculcated us with the same values.  Most of us have been raised to think about our futures for as long as we can remember.  It starts with math workbooks.  Gifted summer camps.  Endless SAT prep.  All for the sake of fabulous college applications, which lead us to the best universities.  The best internships.  The best (read: most lucrative, most prestigious, most stable) careers, which usually fall somewhere in the vicinity of medicine, law, engineering, and (corporate) business.",
				"In midst of all this striving for the best, there’s little to no attention paid to what we might actually enjoy.  That would be indulgent, if not completely unheard of.  There’s little concern in Asian cultures for personal strengths and weaknesses; there’s no such thing as someone who’s \"not a math person\" or \"not an science person,\" because excellence in any area can be attained through hard work.  There’s nothing that can’t be achieved through more repetitions or more discipline.  Failure to excel at something is not attributed to our unique dispositions; it’s attributed solely to laziness or lack of effort, and that is unacceptable.  As a result, we’re trained to excel at everything.  We become excellent at jumping through hoops and knocking down any task that’s placed before us. That’s what we end up enjoying, at least while we’re in school.  These are not terrible skills to have, mind you.  But the flip side is that as we’re trained be great at everything, there’s very little attention paid to what among those things we actually like.  Generally speaking, this is not on our parents’ radars at all, and as a result, it goes neglected on ours.",
				"The result of all of this: a generation of Asian Americans who are excellent at achieving but have no idea what they want to do.  (Or, if they do know, are reluctant to pursue it because it isn’t as stable or well-paid as their current jobs.)  A generation that is incredibly successful but, professionally speaking, not terribly happy.",
				"Not to say that there aren’t Asian Americans who, in the midst of racking up achievements, figured out and pursued what interested them.  And there are certainly Asian parents who are exceptions to the rule, who are actually interested in what their children want to do and support them regardless.  I have Asian American friends who are graphic designers, actors, community activists; who are rethinking math pedagogy for Teach for America and doing campus ministry; and yes, even a few who enjoy being doctors and programmers and brand managers.  Their numbers, however, are dwarfed by the scores of Asian Americans I know who would be much happier in other fields — engineers who should be teachers and filmmakers, lawyers who should be writers, doctors who should be chefs.  And, of course, those who have no idea what they should be doing.",
				"Also, I’m not trying to invalidate or trivialize how difficult this quarter-life crisis is.  It’s a crisis, after all, because there are significant pros and cons to all available options.  But I can’t help but wonder what kind of creative, innovative projects and careers Asian Americans would tackle if they weren’t confined — psychologically, financially, or culturally — to jobs they didn’t enjoy.  And how much happier and more fulfilled they might be as a result.",
				"***",
				"Of course, I draw not only from my peers’ experiences but also my own. I grew up as a little achieving machine.  My parents weren’t just Asian immigrants; they were Asian immigrants who came here to get PhDs and went on to become professors, so education was paramount in our family.  The value of education (and stability it would eventually bring me) was so strong that my mom didn’t even need to be a tiger mom; by elementary school, I had so deeply internalized it that she didn’t need to do anything to motivate me to achieve.  In high school, I cleaned up across the board — not only in math and science, the stereotypically Asian subjects my parents taught, but also in English and social studies.  I had to be the best at everything.  There was no excuse not to be.",
				"In the midst of all this achieving, I also figured out what I wanted to study:  Oddly enough, the recurring refrain of \"Why are you like that?  Like, the way you are?\" in My So-Called Life, which I watched obsessively in 7th grade, triggered an interest in psychology.  My parents were down with this, because they expected a doctorate degree, and whether it was in medicine or psychology, I would have tangible career options.  So I went off to college as a psych major.  Meanwhile, my Asian American friends swarmed to engineering and premed classes, spending long days in the chem lab or long nights in the computer lab, which they almost universally loathed.  I toiled with them for one semester, taking multivariable calculus and organic chemistry (\"to challenge myself,\" I said at the time, though in retrospect, I think I just had something to prove) before retiring from all things premed.  For the next 3 years, I looked at my peers with a mix of pity and smugness.  They mindlessly studied what their parents wanted them to study, but I was studying something I actually liked.",
				"I kept this chip on my shoulder for years — until I found myself midway through a PhD program and seriously questioning if I wanted to be there.  I found myself in the very position for which I had judged my peers:  I was pursuing a secure, well-paying career that my parents wanted for me but I wasn’t sure I wanted.  Meanwhile, the people in college I smirked at for their hapless pursuit of stable careers — they were no less happy than I was, but at least they were making great money.  All I was doing was accruing debt.",
				"All of this came to a head 4 years ago, when I started the full-time internship that made up my last year of grad school, and I realized that my worst fears had come true:  I had spent 5 years in school for a career I didn’t want.  I had endured more classes, papers, and exams than I could count; an exhausting master’s thesis and an even more grueling dissertation; countless hours stressing about clinical hours, data analyses, internship applications, and all the other work of grad school.  I was getting my first taste of what my life in this field would be like — a life I spent years doggedly pursuing — and I didn’t like it.",
				"I was also getting my first taste of what many of my peers had been experiencing for years.  Working at a job you hate SUCKS.  Like, REALLY sucks.  Getting up in the morning is terrible, because you’re tired and you don’t want to go to the job you loathe, and then you’re there for 8 hours — the entire time the sun is out — if not longer, and you come home and you’re exhausted and you have no time or energy to do the things you actually want to do.  And you have to do this AGAIN.  And AGAIN.  And AGAIN.  And a respite comes on Friday, if you’re not too tired to enjoy it, and then Sunday comes too quickly and you sink into your weekly funk because you have to repeat the whole cycle AGAIN.  It’s like being in hell.  All I ever thought about that year was my next day off, when I could maybe sneak in a sick day and just sleep….",
				"Meanwhile, the next hoop was being placed in front of me.  Announcements for post-docs started flooding my inbox almost the minute my internship started — post-docs that my peers were applying for, interviewing for, getting.  There was pressure all around me to swim with the current — but could I do it if I was so, you know, unhappy with what I was doing?  Could I really sign up for more of the same?",
				"I started peeling my fingers away, one by one.  I held out for half-time post-docs, which are virtually nonexistent, thinking that maybe I could do what I was trained to do part-time and use the remaining time to pursue something I actually liked.  The few half-time opportunities that materialized fizzled out quickly.  In the end, I was left with a gift:  I did not have a job in my field.  Or any job, for that matter.  I had no choice but to do something else — to maybe figure out what I really wanted to do.  At 28, with a PhD in a field I didn’t want to work in, I was about to embark on the task I should have started 10 years before.",
				"***",
				"I took a very different tack this time around:  Instead of setting a long-term goal and obstinately staying the course, no matter what data I collected along the way, I would look for jobs that interested me and try them.  If I liked them, I would continue; if not, I would quit.  And I would see what opportunities unfolded that way.  After years of meticulously planning my professional life, this strategy — one that involved working forward and not backward, in which my future would be determined by opportunities that may or may not arise — was terrifying.  But it was also thrilling — like stepping onto a tightrope without a 5-year plan to catch me.  And, well, I had seen how my previous strategy played out.  I didn’t think I could do much worse.",
				"So, new game plan in hand, I started my job hunt.  I got an adjunct professor position at my alma mater; aside from the absurd amounts of prep work and the occasional entitled student, I found that I really enjoyed teaching, and it was a much better fit for me than clinical work.  Then a friend from college asked if I would be interested in working with high school students, which I had done in undergrad and was happy to take up again.  That job also led to some consulting work, which I had never done before but turned out to be right up my alley.  Thus I patched together a professional life, running from meeting to class to meeting — but, in a dramatic change from the previous year, I loved going to work.  Each of my jobs felt meaningful, played to my strengths, and had far more awesome moments than terrible ones.  I finally got a taste for what it was like to do work that was life-giving, and it was fantastic.  On top of that, I found that my satisfaction at work trickled into every other area of my life; after a year of being a zombie, I was happy, well-rested, energetic.  I felt alive again.",
				"Then, a few months ago, we had to move for my husband’s job, and I found myself back at square one.  As wonderful as youth work and teaching were, I didn’t feel a strong need to continue either one.  So back I went to trying-and-seeing.  Two of my professors from grad school offered me a job as a consultant, helping millennials figure out what they want to do with their lives.  Given my experiences, both professional (therapy, assessment, working with students, consulting) and personal (knowing intimately how it felt to end up in the wrong career and to wonder what I was doing with my life), this felt like an excellent fit — and it was, for once, something I could see myself doing long-term.  I had also wanted for years to write more seriously — a desire that I had struggled to acknowledge, fearing that it sounded pretentious, frivolous, or both — and it appeared that I now had time to give that a shot.  But I also needed an income as I built up these lines of work, so I looked for yet another job.  I applied to work at a few independent bookstores, something I had always thought would be fun but never had the chance to try.  One took a chance and hired me, even though I was both incredibly overqualified and incredibly underqualified.  So I find myself splitting my time between three different gigs yet again.",
				"And lo and behold, I am happy, for the same reasons I was in my previous trifecta of employment.  Obviously, the situation isn’t perfect:  I spend every day shifting between very different tasks.  At the moment, I make significantly less than my peers from grad school, who are now licensed psychologists, and pretty much everyone I went to college with.  My resume makes no sense at all.  I’m almost 31, and I’ve made only the slightest headway into a career I want to have.  But for me, all of that pales in comparison to how it feels to be doing work that I actually enjoy.  After years of jumping through hoops because it was all I knew how to do, of achieving for the sake of achieving, I’m finally doing work that I find meaningful.  And it feels pretty awesome.  In a sharp contrast to my previous way of living, I have no idea what my life will look like in 5 years — but I’m content and fulfilled right now, and that feels like a good trade-off.",
				"***",
				"Now, I’m not saying that what I did is the right thing to do and that every Asian American who’s unhappy with their job should leave it immediately.  I am lucky to have no student loans or house payments or children to support, to have a husband who is entirely supportive and as eager to see me in a job I love as I am, to have parents who had ample warning about this sea change and accepted it with minimal resistance, and on and on and on.  I recognize that some people have children, parental demands, mortgages, and other constraints that keep them from making similar changes — and some have found a way to be content in the midst of less-than-thrilling careers.  I respect that.",
				"But in my case, I felt so dissatisfied with the path I was on that I needed to ask myself some serious questions about the choices I was making — and judging from all the conversations I’ve had in the last 10 years with other Asian Americans about their jobs, I don’t think I’m alone.  I don’t think that pursuing careers that are safe and stable is a bad thing by any means; having a consistent income, health insurance, and resources to live in a safe neighborhood with good schools is nothing to sneeze at.  But I worry that as a community, we hyperfocus on security and stability to the point where we don’t think to explore what could be life-giving and fulfilling for us.  And as a result, a lot of us walk around not very happy with our professional lives — which is to say, for most of our waking hours — and not really knowing how to change that.",
				"I don’t have any easy answers or one-size-fits-all solutions, but I do think we need to spend more time reflecting on our choices, both individually and collectively.  And I wonder what would happen if we allowed ourselves more room to explore.  I wonder what kinds of things we would pursue — and how much more fulfilled we could be.",
				"***",
				"A final thought:  If anything here has resonated with you, I’d like to hear your story, too.  If you left your career, if you decided to stay, if you’re trying to figure that out right now — what has your process been like?  What’s made it hard or easy for you to make your decision?  How will you advise your children, should you choose to have them?  I’m super-curious to hear."			],

				"'It takes courage to grow up and be who you really are.' — e.e. cummings",
				"About 6 months ago, I decided to quit my very good job at Google to explore a different way to live life. I had a loose plan of how I wanted to spend my time, but the main reason I left was that I couldn't stay. I couldn't put it into words at the time, but something inside of me was telling me I shouldn't continue down the career path I was on. I felt strongly that it wasn't getting me closer to where I wanted to be, though that destination was largely unknown, and I had to get off that road. Each month I stayed, I grew more anxious and, in turn, resentful. I could wait until I knew exactly which exit I was supposed to take, but I knew it would be harder to turn around as time went on, and what if I never knew which exit was right? The only thing of which I was certain was that no one was going to tell me how to get there; not my manager, not my co workers, not my friends, not my parents. I envisioned an older version of myself with a wonderful husband, beautiful kids, a mortgage and a crippling sense that I had missed my opportunity to dig deeper into what I really wanted out of life. So I swerved in January 2013 and took the next exit.",
				"When people ask me what it was like to leave, I liken my experience of leaving Google to breaking up with my college boyfriend. He was brilliant, good looking, respected, and everyone loved him — I even loved him — but he wasn't the one. It used to catch up with me on long bus rides my senior year, staring out the window, and I'd get a knot in the pit of my stomach. Realizing that I had to let him go was a slow and difficult process, but it was the right thing to do and I eventually mustered up the courage to break both of our hearts. I wasn't sure I would ever meet someone like him again, but leaving that relationship opened me up for so much more later on, and I continue to think of that decision as one of the most pivotal in my life. It took me several years to reach the same conclusion about corporate life at Google — it was almost unimaginable to give up a salary, a manager who treated me like family and co-workers I genuinely considered friends. I had worked so hard for it. I couldn't let it go, even though I was in many ways unhappy.",
				"When I sat down and really thought about why I was resisting, I realized something about myself that I didn't like, something that I'm ashamed to even admit now. The main reason I was resisting was because I would be giving up the safety and prestige associated with life as a Googler. When I reflected more, I realized that external recognition had unfortunately become a primary motivator for me. It started back in kindergarten when Mrs. Money told my Mom I was the brightest student she'd had in 40+ years of teaching. All my friends have stories like this — we were all those kids. Over time, being recognized for what I did became more exciting as the stakes grew higher (honor roll, getting into prep school, getting into Wellesley, getting an award in college, getting a prized internship, getting a job at Google). The problem I now faced was what to do when what I wanted to do next (give it all up) didn't come with many brownie points at all, except maybe that I was gutsy. Nothing had prepared me for that. In fact, the need for recognition was still so engrained in me that I leaned on my start up as a crutch during my exit from Google. 'I'm leaving to work on my start up idea.' That was shorter and more palatable than 'I'm taking time to slow down and better understand myself and what I want out of this life.'",
				"It was during my last promotion at work that I realized something was really off, more so than the dull anxiety I felt pretty consistently after Year 1 post-college. Year 1 was too much of a whirlwind to stop and think about what I was doing, between making money for the first time, meeting my incredible start class, going through training, being thrown into the deep end with clients. I fell in love with Google that year and I also fell in love with a Googler, so I was pretty distracted from asking larger questions about life. But what I noticed, years later, in my last promotion at Google, was that the incremental gains I was making in my role weren't making me incrementally happier. If anything, the promotion made me less happy because it made me feel like I was putting all my energy into something I wasn't even sure about. The money was nice, but it didn't change my lifestyle. I felt really guilty almost all the time. Wasn't Google supposed to be the best place to work? Wasn't I supposed to cherish my six figure salary, free meals, massages, etc? I did feel incredibly thankful, but I also felt like a jerk. The truth was I felt unfulfilled and I was scared to tell anyone.",
				"I wish my own inner voice had said, 'Hey Elle, this gig does have a lot of great things going for it, but maybe it's time to leave.' Instead it said, 'Hey Elle, everyone wants this, so you probably should too. Find a way to love it. Be good at it. Stop complaining. ' And so I did — I worked hard, I got sent to Tokyo for three months, I worked with exciting clients like Square, I led diversity initiatives in my office, I trained new team members. The truth is that I grew up at Google — it's where I learned to do good work. It was my MBA. But my heart wasn't in it anymore. I knew it, but I still couldn't leave. I had the power to change my life and I wouldn't do it. It wasn't my parents — my parents had always been supportive of me doing whatever I wanted, even if that meant leaving — it was me. It was my fear of failure that made me stay, my fear of what people would think. It was no one's pressure but my own. And that was the worst kind because it never went away. It was with me from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep, and sometimes in my dreams too. For years I had a recurring dream that I was being chased, jumping through windows and doors, but never getting further away from my chaser. In real life, I asked myself every day, why am I here? What am I doing? I felt like an impostor in my own life.",
				"My anxiety peaked at the end of 2012 and I decided to take a month off work around the holidays to see if simply not working would help me get clarity. It threw everyone off that I hadn't planned an elaborate European vacation with the four weeks I was taking. I told everyone I was staying at home in San Francisco to just 'live life.' I went to ballet most mornings, I went to the grocery store and cooked for myself (a novelty for Googlers), I started baking again, I read, I ran, I played guitar, I neglected email. Quite simply, I spent more time enjoying the small pleasures in life I never prioritized when working, hoping that a light would go off. I had fun, but there was no light much to my disappointment. Maybe I should have gone to Europe after all, I thought.",
				"And then, as my month off came to an end, I decided on a whim to go to Joshua Tree for New Year's with one of my close college friends, her boyfriend and a collection of their friends who lived in LA. As we were huddled around the campfire before midnight, in 20 degree weather, one of their friends began to ask me about myself. Almost everyone there was an artist of some sort, so I remember feeling shy about the fact I worked at a huge tech company. It was almost like admitting I worked for the IRS. He asked what I did for work and how long I'd been doing it and I told him. His response was, 'So you must really like it then to be there for so long. What about it? What's it like?' It felt like so many questions, so intrusive, but he was just being conversational. I remember saying something nice (most likely I said 'the people are great' which is true), but I remember feeling defensive, like I was being tested. In reality, that was all in my head, but that was my light going off…for the first time I was recognizing inauthenticity in myself. I couldn't stand it.",
				"After that conversation, I wandered away from the campfire for a few minutes to get a better look at the stars. The moon had never looked so big. I could hear old school hip hop from our camp in the distance, but I was surrounded by absolutely nothing and no one, and I felt free in the universe. It was that moment that I realized I was truly free to do whatever I wanted in this world and it was completely up to me to make it happen. It was my life, and I had to stop caring what people thought about it. If I wanted to bake, I should. If I wanted to write, I should. If I wanted to start a company, I should. If I wanted to do nothing, I should. If I wanted to fuck up for once, I should. I was probably only out there for a few minutes before someone tapped my shoulder to go back to the fire (it was so cold that night your pee froze as soon as it hit the ground), but it felt like an eternity. Maybe I would have reached this conclusion had I stayed in San Francisco, but I really believe it was the magic of being nowhere that did it. Being nowhere forced me to stay silent long enough to hear what I hadn't wanted to admit: I wasn't living authentically. When I returned to work, I gave my notice immediately. My explanation of what I was leaving to do (explore some hobbies, work on a few projects, bake more) confused everyone, but they were all fully supportive. Ironically and quite magically, the day I returned (which was also the day I gave notice), an award was sitting on my desk that I had won while I was out: 'Most Likely To Build A Start Up In The Next 5 Years.'",
				"Fast forward a few months and I'm still constantly bombarded with questions from family, friends, old co-workers and strangers about what life is like now. Sometimes it's glamorous; most times (like when I'm calculating how much time I have left before I run out of money) it's not. The truth is that going off the rails into the complete unknown is terrifying and it's lonely — some days I'm so paralyzed with fear about everything I can hardly do anything, but the other truth is a really important and big one: for the first time in my life, my identity is not 100% tied to my accomplishments, I care less about what people think of me and I spend more time on work that feels right. I am improving my ability to listen to my inner voice and not judge what it wants. I can question myself and answer truthfully.",
				"For me the answers to those questions led me to make some big changes in my work life, like giving up the job, exploring projects I used to think weren't worthy enough of my time (baking) and building a start up that is risky and deeply personal (Mend). In my personal life, it meant learning how to say no and better balance social obligations so that I could spend more time alone. It also meant making a physical move to Venice (the one in CA, not Italy) so that I could fulfill my dreams of a spacious 1br apartment to myself (which I couldn't shell out $3k for in SF), running on the beach every day and slowing down my pace of life from the frenetic and get-acquired-or-die San Francisco of 2013. It was hard to leave behind my best friends and give up the dizzyingly engaging Peter Pan life the Bay Area offers to 20 somethings, but when I walk along the beach alone on a warm summer night and watch the sunset behind the Santa Monica mountains, I know I'm finally home. Though I still only have vague dreams about the destination, I'm no longer constantly looking for the exit and that's how I know I'm on the right road. The caveat here is that studying hard my whole life and saving for almost 5 years afforded me the opportunity to have this time completely off payroll, but I think that everyone has the right and responsibility to go to Joshua Tree, metaphorically speaking. Everyone can dial everything back; the hard part is listening to what you have to say and doing something about it.",

But you can only invest so much money in the business. Where should you put your resources? Should you hire another baker? Buy another stove? Start your own rhubarb farm? You need to make a careful, data-based analysis of these options to figure out where the primary bottleneck is, and thus where you should concentrate your efforts.",
				"Business school types have a word for this sort of analysis: operations. Operations determines how products get manufactured and how services get delivered. Improving operations can cut costs, making the things you buy cheaper. It can speed processes, getting those things to you more swiftly. It can eliminate waste, doing a favor to the environment. You can thank (or blame) operations for the manner in which you're admitted into a hospital, screened at an airport, or served at a busy fast-food restaurant. ",
				"For the next few weeks, I will be exploring the world of operations management in a series for Slate. It is a world full of ingenuity, practicality, and even beauty. It draws on fields ranging from engineering and math to psychology and sociology. Simply put, operations is the science of making things run better. Once you start thinking like an operations geek, it can transform the way you think about everything, from your workplace to your commute to the way you make a PB&J.",
				"One important and enduring corner of the operations world—the one we'll be exploring today—is queuing theory. Queuing theory is the study of lines. All kinds of lines. The lines at supermarket checkouts, the lines at toll booths, the lines of people on hold waiting for someone, anyone, to pick up at the cable company’s 1-800 number. ",
				"MIT professor Dick Larson is perhaps America's foremost scholar of queuing theory. (This distinction has earned him the Bond-villain-ish nickname \"Dr. Queue.\") According to Larson, queuing theory got its start about 100 years ago in Denmark, necessitated by a booming new technology: the telephone.",
				"If your phone connected only to one other phone, it wouldn’t be very useful. What made telephony so valuable and popular was the ability to connect to thousands upon thousands of other phones. But this required a hub-and-spoke network, with calls coming into a switchbox and then being routed on their merry ways. ",
				"Back in 1909, calls were routed by operators using switching equipment. To maximize profits, telephone companies needed to know how precisely many operators and switches were necessary to handle call volumes. Too few operators and switches, and the calls would stack up, annoying waiting customers. Too many, and the company would be wasting money on excess labor and equipment. A Dane named Agner Krarup Erlang was assigned to study the problem. The equations he devised, says Larson, still get used today in operations—any time a manager needs to calculate the probability that a queue will build up given a certain volume of tasks and a certain amount of task-accomplishing resources.",
				"Corporate call centers these days tweak their algorithms to achieve similar but slightly more complicated goals. For instance, the highest paid service representatives at the call center are trained to handle very complex interactions with customers, while the lowest paid reps are qualified for only the most basic tasks. The call center attempts to optimize the distribution of incoming calls so that you’re sent to the lowest-paid rep who is still capable of addressing your complaint, freeing up the more expensive reps to solve the thornier problems. This is why you’re always being asked to describe your problem by punching numbers on the keyboard before you talk to a human being. Which in itself raises another operations challenge: how to get maximum information from the caller without ticking her off so much that she hangs up the phone in anger after her seventh keypad touch. ",
				"Though queuing math hasn’t changed a ton since 1909, this kind of queuing psychology has. According to Larson, since the mid-20th century, queuing theory has been more about feelings than formulas. For example: Midcentury New York featured a rush-hour crisis—not out on the roads, but inside office tower lobbies. There weren’t enough elevators to handle the peak crowds. Complaints were mounting. \"One solution would have been to dynamite the buildings and build more elevator shafts,\" says Larson. \"But someone figured out the real problem isn’t just the duration of a delay. It’s how you experience that duration.\" Some buildings installed floor-to-ceiling mirrors near the elevators and, entertained by their own reflections and by the flirting that sometimes ensued, people stopped complaining quite as much about the wait time.",
				"There are three givens of human nature that queuing psychologists must address: 1) We get bored when we wait in line. 2) We really hate it when we expect a short wait and then get a long one. 3) We really, really hate it when someone shows up after us but gets served before us. ",
				"The boredom issue has been tackled in myriad ways—from the mirrors next to elevator banks to the TVs in dentist’s waiting rooms. Larson mentions a clever solution from the Manhattan Savings Bank, which once hired a concert pianist to play in its lobby as customers waited for tellers. \"But Disney has been the absolute master of this aspect of queue psychology,\" says Larson. \"You might wait 45 minutes for an 8-minute ride at Disney World. But they’ll make you feel like the ride has started while you’re still on line. They build excitement and provide all kinds of diversions in the queue channel.\" Video screens tease the thrills ahead, and a series of varied chambers that the queue moves through creates a sense of progress. Another solution: those buzzing pagers that restaurants in malls sometimes give you while you’re waiting for a table. Instead of focusing on the misery of the wait, you can go off and entertain yourself—secure in the knowledge that you’ll be alerted when it’s your turn.",
				"How to play the expectations game? Studies show that we’re much more patient when we’re given an idea of how long we’ll be waiting, instead of wondering whether it will be three minutes or three hours. So, for example, some New York City subway platforms now feature digital displays featuring estimated arrival times for the next few trains. But again, Disney is the master. It posts estimated wait times next to various spots in its long queues—but, according to Larson, it pads the times so you always get to the head of the line more quickly than you’d expected: \"You think, ‘We’re 10 minutes ahead of schedule!’ and so you’re happy.\" ",
				"Perhaps the most emotional issue in the world of queuing is the human quest for fairness. \"When we see people arrive after us and get served before us we get very angry,\" says Larson. \"We can remember it for days, sometimes. And there have been incidents of ‘queue rage.’ People have drawn knives and guns.\"",
				"Sometimes we will make exceptions. We seem to be OK with the idea of an express lane at the supermarket—someone buying one roll of paper towels shouldn’t be forced to wait behind someone buying a full cart of groceries. We also allow for differing priorities at an ER, with more critical cases being admitted first even if they showed up last. ",
				"But in most situations, we demand social fairness. No one is more important than anyone else, and everyone should be served in the order he or she arrived. No doubt you’ve experienced mild queue rage when you choose the wrong line at a fast food counter or a drug store, watching people in the other lines zoom ahead of you.",
				"To solve this problem, some genius (Wendy’s, American Airlines, and Citibank are among the companies that claim to be originators) invented the serpentine line. The serpentine line funnels all customers into one big snaking queue, demarcated by ropes or barriers. When you reach the head of the queue, you are directed to the next available server, or teller, or customs official. The serpentine line isn’t always faster than a simple scrum before an array of cash registers. But it offers important solace: You absolutely never have to see someone arrive after you and get served before you.",
				"Larson says he was once at a queuing theory conference where the hotel checkout line became quite long and was populated mainly by queuing theorists. \"We insisted on forming our own serpentine line,\" he says. \"The lobby wasn’t designed for it and it looked extremely messy. The hotel manager was unhappy. If we’d just dispersed into six parallel lines at the checkout desk the wait might have been shorter and less chaotic. But it would have been less fair.\""

"EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO my job as the first woman director of policy planning at the State Department, a foreign-policy dream job that traces its origins back to George Kennan, I found myself in New York, at the United Nations' annual assemblage of every foreign minister and head of state in the world. On a Wednesday evening, President and Mrs. Obama hosted a glamorous reception at the American Museum of Natural History. I sipped champagne, greeted foreign dignitaries, and mingled. But I could not stop thinking about my 14-year-old son, who had started eighth grade three weeks earlier and was already resuming what had become his pattern of skipping homework, disrupting classes, failing math, and tuning out any adult who tried to reach him. Over the summer, we had barely spoken to each other—or, more accurately, he had barely spoken to me. And the previous spring I had received several urgent phone calls—invariably on the day of an important meeting—that required me to take the first train from Washington, D.C., where I worked, back to Princeton, New Jersey, where he lived. My husband, who has always done everything possible to support my career, took care of him and his 12-year-old brother during the week; outside of those midweek emergencies, I came home only on weekends.",
"As the evening wore on, I ran into a colleague who held a senior position in the White House. She has two sons exactly my sons' ages, but she had chosen to move them from California to D.C. when she got her job, which meant her husband commuted back to California regularly. I told her how difficult I was finding it to be away from my son when he clearly needed me. Then I said, \"When this is over, I'm going to write an op-ed titled 'Women Can't Have It All.'\"",
"She was horrified. \"You can't write that,\" she said. \"You, of all people.\" What she meant was that such a statement, coming from a high-profile career woman—a role model—would be a terrible signal to younger generations of women. By the end of the evening, she had talked me out of it, but for the remainder of my stint in Washington, I was increasingly aware that the feminist beliefs on which I had built my entire career were shifting under my feet. I had always assumed that if I could get a foreign-policy job in the State Department or the White House while my party was in power, I would stay the course as long as I had the opportunity to do work I loved. But in January 2011, when my two-year public-service leave from Princeton University was up, I hurried home as fast as I could.",
"A rude epiphany hit me soon after I got there. When people asked why I had left government, I explained that I'd come home not only because of Princeton's rules (after two years of leave, you lose your tenure), but also because of my desire to be with my family and my conclusion that juggling high-level government work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible. I have not exactly left the ranks of full-time career women: I teach a full course load; write regular print and online columns on foreign policy; give 40 to 50 speeches a year; appear regularly on TV and radio; and am working on a new academic book. But I routinely got reactions from other women my age or older that ranged from disappointed (\"It's such a pity that you had to leave Washington\") to condescending (\"I wouldn't generalize from your experience. I've never had to compromise, and my kids turned out great\").",
"The first set of reactions, with the underlying assumption that my choice was somehow sad or unfortunate, was irksome enough. But it was the second set of reactions—those implying that my parenting and/or my commitment to my profession were somehow substandard—that triggered a blind fury. Suddenly, finally, the penny dropped. All my life, I'd been on the other side of this exchange. I'd been the woman smiling the faintly superior smile while another woman told me she had decided to take some time out or pursue a less competitive career track so that she could spend more time with her family. I'd been the woman congratulating herself on her unswerving commitment to the feminist cause, chatting smugly with her dwindling number of college or law-school friends who had reached and maintained their place on the highest rungs of their profession. I'd been the one telling young women at my lectures that you can have it all and do it all, regardless of what field you are in. Which means I'd been part, albeit unwittingly, of making millions of women feel that they are to blame if they cannot manage to rise up the ladder as fast as men and also have a family and an active home life (and be thin and beautiful to boot).",
"Last spring, I flew to Oxford to give a public lecture. At the request of a young Rhodes Scholar I know, I'd agreed to talk to the Rhodes community about \"work-family balance.\" I ended up speaking to a group of about 40 men and women in their mid-20s. What poured out of me was a set of very frank reflections on how unexpectedly hard it was to do the kind of job I wanted to do as a high government official and be the kind of parent I wanted to be, at a demanding time for my children (even though my husband, an academic, was willing to take on the lion's share of parenting for the two years I was in Washington). I concluded by saying that my time in office had convinced me that further government service would be very unlikely while my sons were still at home. The audience was rapt, and asked many thoughtful questions. One of the first was from a young woman who began by thanking me for \"not giving just one more fatuous 'You can have it all' talk.\" Just about all of the women in that room planned to combine careers and family in some way. But almost all assumed and accepted that they would have to make compromises that the men in their lives were far less likely to have to make.",
"The striking gap between the responses I heard from those young women (and others like them) and the responses I heard from my peers and associates prompted me to write this article. Women of my generation have clung to the feminist credo we were raised with, even as our ranks have been steadily thinned by unresolvable tensions between family and career, because we are determined not to drop the flag for the next generation. But when many members of the younger generation have stopped listening, on the grounds that glibly repeating \"you can have it all\" is simply airbrushing reality, it is time to talk.",
"I still strongly believe that women can \"have it all\" (and that men can too). I believe that we can \"have it all at the same time.\" But not today, not with the way America's economy and society are currently structured. My experiences over the past three years have forced me to confront a number of uncomfortable facts that need to be widely acknowledged—and quickly changed.",
"BEFORE MY SERVICE in government, I'd spent my career in academia: as a law professor and then as the dean of Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Both were demanding jobs, but I had the ability to set my own schedule most of the time. I could be with my kids when I needed to be, and still get the work done. I had to travel frequently, but I found I could make up for that with an extended period at home or a family vacation.",
"I knew that I was lucky in my career choice, but I had no idea how lucky until I spent two years in Washington within a rigid bureaucracy, even with bosses as understanding as Hillary Clinton and her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills. My workweek started at 4:20 on Monday morning, when I got up to get the 5:30 train from Trenton to Washington. It ended late on Friday, with the train home. In between, the days were crammed with meetings, and when the meetings stopped, the writing work began—a never-ending stream of memos, reports, and comments on other people's drafts. For two years, I never left the office early enough to go to any stores other than those open 24 hours, which meant that everything from dry cleaning to hair appointments to Christmas shopping had to be done on weekends, amid children's sporting events, music lessons, family meals, and conference calls. I was entitled to four hours of vacation per pay period, which came to one day of vacation a month. And I had it better than many of my peers in D.C.; Secretary Clinton deliberately came in around 8 a.m. and left around 7 p.m., to allow her close staff to have morning and evening time with their families (although of course she worked earlier and later, from home).",
"In short, the minute I found myself in a job that is typical for the vast majority of working women (and men), working long hours on someone else's schedule, I could no longer be both the parent and the professional I wanted to be—at least not with a child experiencing a rocky adolescence. I realized what should have perhaps been obvious: having it all, at least for me, depended almost entirely on what type of job I had. The flip side is the harder truth: having it all was not possible in many types of jobs, including high government office—at least not for very long.",
"I am hardly alone in this realization. Michèle Flournoy stepped down after three years as undersecretary of defense for policy, the third-highest job in the department, to spend more time at home with her three children, two of whom are teenagers. Karen Hughes left her position as the counselor to President George W. Bush after a year and a half in Washington to go home to Texas for the sake of her family. Mary Matalin, who spent two years as an assistant to Bush and the counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney before stepping down to spend more time with her daughters, wrote: \"Having control over your schedule is the only way that women who want to have a career and a family can make it work.\"",
"Yet the decision to step down from a position of power—to value family over professional advancement, even for a time—is directly at odds with the prevailing social pressures on career professionals in the United States. One phrase says it all about current attitudes toward work and family, particularly among elites. In Washington, \"leaving to spend time with your family\" is a euphemism for being fired. This understanding is so ingrained that when Flournoy announced her resignation last December, TheNew York Times covered her decision as follows:",
"Ms. Flournoy's announcement surprised friends and a number of Pentagon officials, but all said they took her reason for resignation at face value and not as a standard Washington excuse for an official who has in reality been forced out. \"I can absolutely and unequivocally state that her decision to step down has nothing to do with anything other than her commitment to her family,\" said Doug Wilson, a top Pentagon spokesman. \"She has loved this job and people here love her.",
"Think about what this \"standard Washington excuse\" implies: it is so unthinkable that an official would actually step down to spend time with his or her family that this must be a cover for something else. How could anyone voluntarily leave the circles of power for the responsibilities of parenthood? Depending on one's vantage point, it is either ironic or maddening that this view abides in the nation's capital, despite the ritual commitments to \"family values\" that are part of every political campaign. Regardless, this sentiment makes true work-life balance exceptionally difficult. But it cannot change unless top women speak out.",
"Only recently have I begun to appreciate the extent to which many young professional women feel under assault by women my age and older. After I gave a recent speech in New York, several women in their late 60s or early 70s came up to tell me how glad and proud they were to see me speaking as a foreign-policy expert. A couple of them went on, however, to contrast my career with the path being traveled by \"younger women today.\" One expressed dismay that many younger women \"are just not willing to get out there and do it.\" Said another, unaware of the circumstances of my recent job change: \"They think they have to choose between having a career and having a family.\"",
"A similar assumption underlies Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's widely publicized 2011 commencement speech at Barnard, and her earlier TED talk, in which she lamented the dismally small number of women at the top and advised young women not to \"leave before you leave.\" When a woman starts thinking about having children, Sandberg said, \"she doesn't raise her hand anymore … She starts leaning back.\" Although couched in terms of encouragement, Sandberg's exhortation contains more than a note of reproach. We who have made it to the top, or are striving to get there, are essentially saying to the women in the generation behind us: \"What's the matter with you?\"",
"They have an answer that we don't want to hear. After the speech I gave in New York, I went to dinner with a group of 30-somethings. I sat across from two vibrant women, one of whom worked at the UN and the other at a big New York law firm. As nearly always happens in these situations, they soon began asking me about work-life balance. When I told them I was writing this article, the lawyer said, \"I look for role models and can't find any.\" She said the women in her firm who had become partners and taken on management positions had made tremendous sacrifices, \"many of which they don't even seem to realize … They take two years off when their kids are young but then work like crazy to get back on track professionally, which means that they see their kids when they are toddlers but not teenagers, or really barely at all.\" Her friend nodded, mentioning the top professional women she knew, all of whom essentially relied on round-the-clock nannies. Both were very clear that they did not want that life, but could not figure out how to combine professional success and satisfaction with a real commitment to family.",
"I realize that I am blessed to have been born in the late 1950s instead of the early 1930s, as my mother was, or the beginning of the 20th century, as my grandmothers were. My mother built a successful and rewarding career as a professional artist largely in the years after my brothers and I left home—and after being told in her 20s that she could not go to medical school, as her father had done and her brother would go on to do, because, of course, she was going to get married. I owe my own freedoms and opportunities to the pioneering generation of women ahead of me—the women now in their 60s, 70s, and 80s who faced overt sexism of a kind I see only when watching Mad Men, and who knew that the only way to make it as a woman was to act exactly like a man. To admit to, much less act on, maternal longings would have been fatal to their careers.",
"But precisely thanks to their progress, a different kind of conversation is now possible. It is time for women in leadership positions to recognize that although we are still blazing trails and breaking ceilings, many of us are also reinforcing a falsehood: that \"having it all\" is, more than anything, a function of personal determination. As Kerry Rubin and Lia Macko, the authors of Midlife Crisis at 30, their cri de coeur for Gen-X and Gen-Y women, put it:",
"What we discovered in our research is that while the empowerment part of the equation has been loudly celebrated, there has been very little honest discussion among women of our age about the real barriers and flaws that still exist in the system despite the opportunities we inherited.",
"I am well aware that the majority of American women face problems far greater than any discussed in this article. I am writing for my demographic—highly educated, well-off women who are privileged enough to have choices in the first place. We may not have choices about whether to do paid work, as dual incomes have become indispensable. But we have choices about the type and tempo of the work we do. We are the women who could be leading, and who should be equally represented in the leadership ranks.",
"Millions of other working women face much more difficult life circumstances. Some are single mothers; many struggle to find any job; others support husbands who cannot find jobs. Many cope with a work life in which good day care is either unavailable or very expensive; school schedules do not match work schedules; and schools themselves are failing to educate their children. Many of these women are worrying not about having it all, but rather about holding on to what they do have. And although women as a group have made substantial gains in wages, educational attainment, and prestige over the past three decades, the economists Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson have shown that women are less happy today than their predecessors were in 1972, both in absolute terms and relative to men.",
"The best hope for improving the lot of all women, and for closing what Wolfers and Stevenson call a \"new gender gap\"—measured by well-being rather than wages—is to close the leadership gap: to elect a woman president and 50 women senators; to ensure that women are equally represented in the ranks of corporate executives and judicial leaders. Only when women wield power in sufficient numbers will we create a society that genuinely works for all women. That will be a society that works for everyone.",
"The Half-Truths We Hold Dear",
"Let's briefly examine the stories we tell ourselves, the clichés that I and many other women typically fall back on when younger women ask us how we have managed to \"have it all.\" They are not necessarily lies, but at best partial truths. We must clear them out of the way to make room for a more honest and productive discussion about real solutions to the problems faced by professional women.",
"It's possible if you are just committed enough.",
"Our usual starting point, whether we say it explicitly or not, is that having it all depends primarily on the depth and intensity of a woman's commitment to her career. That is precisely the sentiment behind the dismay so many older career women feel about the younger generation. They are not committed enough, we say, to make the trade-offs and sacrifices that the women ahead of them made.",
"Yet instead of chiding, perhaps we should face some basic facts. Very few women reach leadership positions. The pool of female candidates for any top job is small, and will only grow smaller if the women who come after us decide to take time out, or drop out of professional competition altogether, to raise children. That is exactly what has Sheryl Sandberg so upset, and rightly so. In her words, \"Women are not making it to the top. A hundred and ninety heads of state; nine are women. Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. In the corporate sector, [the share of] women at the top—C-level jobs, board seats—tops out at 15, 16 percent.\"",
"Can \"insufficient commitment\" even plausibly explain these numbers? To be sure, the women who do make it to the top are highly committed to their profession. On closer examination, however, it turns out that most of them have something else in common: they are genuine superwomen. Consider the number of women recently in the top ranks in Washington—Susan Rice, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, Michelle Gavin, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle—who are Rhodes Scholars. Samantha Power, another senior White House official, won a Pulitzer Prize at age 32. Or consider Sandberg herself, who graduated with the prize given to Harvard's top student of economics. These women cannot possibly be the standard against which even very talented professional women should measure themselves. Such a standard sets up most women for a sense of failure.",
"What's more, among those who have made it to the top, a balanced life still is more elusive for women than it is for men. A simple measure is how many women in top positions have children compared with their male colleagues. Every male Supreme Court justice has a family. Two of the three female justices are single with no children. And the third, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, began her career as a judge only when her younger child was almost grown. The pattern is the same at the National Security Council: Condoleezza Rice, the first and only woman national-security adviser, is also the only national-security adviser since the 1950s not to have a family.",
"The line of high-level women appointees in the Obama administration is one woman deep. Virtually all of us who have stepped down have been succeeded by men; searches for women to succeed men in similar positions come up empty. Just about every woman who could plausibly be tapped is already in government. The rest of the foreign-policy world is not much better; Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, recently surveyed the best data he could find across the government, the military, the academy, and think tanks, and found that women hold fewer than 30 percent of the senior foreign-policy positions in each of these institutions.",
"These numbers are all the more striking when we look back to the 1980s, when women now in their late 40s and 50s were coming out of graduate school, and remember that our classes were nearly 50-50 men and women. We were sure then that by now, we would be living in a 50-50 world. Something derailed that dream.",
"Sandberg thinks that \"something\" is an \"ambition gap\"—that women do not dream big enough. I am all for encouraging young women to reach for the stars. But I fear that the obstacles that keep women from reaching the top are rather more prosaic than the scope of their ambition. My longtime and invaluable assistant, who has a doctorate and juggles many balls as the mother of teenage twins, e-mailed me while I was working on this article: \"You know what would help the vast majority of women with work/family balance? MAKE SCHOOL SCHEDULES MATCH WORK SCHEDULES.\" The present system, she noted, is based on a society that no longer exists—one in which farming was a major occupation and stay-at-home moms were the norm. Yet the system hasn't changed.",
"Consider some of the responses of women interviewed by Zenko about why \"women are significantly underrepresented in foreign policy and national security positions in government, academia, and think tanks.\" Juliette Kayyem, who served as an assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2011 and now writes a foreign-policy and national-security column for The Boston Globe, told Zenko that among other reasons,",
"the basic truth is also this: the travel sucks. As my youngest of three children is now 6, I can look back at the years when they were all young and realize just how disruptive all the travel was. There were also trips I couldn't take because I was pregnant or on leave, the conferences I couldn't attend because (note to conference organizers: weekends are a bad choice) kids would be home from school, and the various excursions that were offered but just couldn't be managed.",
"Jolynn Shoemaker, the director of Women in International Security, agreed: \"Inflexible schedules, unrelenting travel, and constant pressure to be in the office are common features of these jobs.\"",
"These \"mundane\" issues—the need to travel constantly to succeed, the conflicts between school schedules and work schedules, the insistence that work be done in the office—cannot be solved by exhortations to close the ambition gap. I would hope to see commencement speeches that finger America's social and business policies, rather than women's level of ambition, in explaining the dearth of women at the top. But changing these policies requires much more than speeches. It means fighting the mundane battles—every day, every year—in individual workplaces, in legislatures, and in the media.",
"It's possible if you marry the right person.",
"Sandberg's second message in her Barnard commencement address was: \"The most important career decision you're going to make is whether or not you have a life partner and who that partner is.\" Lisa Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, recently drove that message home to an audience of Princeton students and alumni gathered to hear her acceptance speech for the James Madison Medal. During the Q&A session, an audience member asked her how she managed her career and her family. She laughed and pointed to her husband in the front row, saying: \"There's my work-life balance.\" I could never have had the career I have had without my husband, Andrew Moravcsik, who is a tenured professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton. Andy has spent more time with our sons than I have, not only on homework, but also on baseball, music lessons, photography, card games, and more. When each of them had to bring in a foreign dish for his fourth-grade class dinner, Andy made his grandmother's Hungarian palacsinta; when our older son needed to memorize his lines for a lead role in a school play, he turned to Andy for help.",
"Still, the proposition that women can have high-powered careers as long as their husbands or partners are willing to share the parenting load equally (or disproportionately) assumes that most women will feel as comfortable as men do about being away from their children, as long as their partner is home with them. In my experience, that is simply not the case.",
"Here I step onto treacherous ground, mined with stereotypes. From years of conversations and observations, however, I've come to believe that men and women respond quite differently when problems at home force them to recognize that their absence is hurting a child, or at least that their presence would likely help. I do not believe fathers love their children any less than mothers do, but men do seem more likely to choose their job at a cost to their family, while women seem more likely to choose their family at a cost to their job.",
"Many factors determine this choice, of course. Men are still socialized to believe that their primary family obligation is to be the breadwinner; women, to believe that their primary family obligation is to be the caregiver. But it may be more than that. When I described the choice between my children and my job to Senator Jeanne Shaheen, she said exactly what I felt: \"There's really no choice.\" She wasn't referring to social expectations, but to a maternal imperative felt so deeply that the \"choice\" is reflexive.",
"Men and women also seem to frame the choice differently. In Midlife Crisis at 30, Mary Matalin recalls her days working as President Bush's assistant and Vice President Cheney's counselor:",
"Even when the stress was overwhelming—those days when I'd cry in the car on the way to work, asking myself \"Why am I doing this??\"—I always knew the answer to that question: I believe in this president.",
"But Matalin goes on to describe her choice to leave in words that are again uncannily similar to the explanation I have given so many people since leaving the State Department:",
"I finally asked myself, \"Who needs me more?\" And that's when I realized, it's somebody else's turn to do this job. I'm indispensable to my kids, but I'm not close to indispensable to the White House.",
"To many men, however, the choice to spend more time with their children, instead of working long hours on issues that affect many lives, seems selfish. Male leaders are routinely praised for having sacrificed their personal life on the altar of public or corporate service. That sacrifice, of course, typically involves their family. Yet their children, too, are trained to value public service over private responsibility. At the diplomat Richard Holbrooke's memorial service, one of his sons told the audience that when he was a child, his father was often gone, not around to teach him to throw a ball or to watch his games. But as he grew older, he said, he realized that Holbrooke's absence was the price of saving people around the world—a price worth paying.",
"It is not clear to me that this ethical framework makes sense for society. Why should we want leaders who fall short on personal responsibilities? Perhaps leaders who invested time in their own families would be more keenly aware of the toll their public choices—on issues from war to welfare—take on private lives. (Kati Marton, Holbrooke's widow and a noted author, says that although Holbrooke adored his children, he came to appreciate the full importance of family only in his 50s, at which point he became a very present parent and grandparent, while continuing to pursue an extraordinary public career.) Regardless, it is clear which set of choices society values more today. Workers who put their careers first are typically rewarded; workers who choose their families are overlooked, disbelieved, or accused of unprofessionalism.",
"In sum, having a supportive mate may well be a necessary condition if women are to have it all, but it is not sufficient. If women feel deeply that turning down a promotion that would involve more travel, for instance, is the right thing to do, then they will continue to do that. Ultimately, it is society that must change, coming to value choices to put family ahead of work just as much as those to put work ahead of family. If we really valued those choices, we would value the people who make them; if we valued the people who make them, we would do everything possible to hire and retain them; if we did everything possible to allow them to combine work and family equally over time, then the choices would get a lot easier.",
"It's possible if you sequence it right.",
"Young women should be wary of the assertion \"You can have it all; you just can't have it all at once.\" This 21st-century addendum to the original line is now proffered by many senior women to their younger mentees. To the extent that it means, in the words of one working mother, \"I'm going to do my best and I'm going to keep the long term in mind and know that it's not always going to be this hard to balance,\" it is sound advice. But to the extent that it means that women can have it all if they just find the right sequence of career and family, it's cheerfully wrong.",
"The most important sequencing issue is when to have children. Many of the top women leaders of the generation just ahead of me—Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, Patricia Wald, Nannerl Keohane—had their children in their 20s and early 30s, as was the norm in the 1950s through the 1970s. A child born when his mother is 25 will finish high school when his mother is 43, an age at which, with full-time immersion in a career, she still has plenty of time and energy for advancement.",
"Yet this sequence has fallen out of favor with many high-potential women, and understandably so. People tend to marry later now, and anyway, if you have children earlier, you may have difficulty getting a graduate degree, a good first job, and opportunities for advancement in the crucial early years of your career. Making matters worse, you will also have less income while raising your children, and hence less ability to hire the help that can be indispensable to your juggling act.",
"When I was the dean, the Woodrow Wilson School created a program called Pathways to Public Service, aimed at advising women whose children were almost grown about how to go into public service, and many women still ask me about the best \"on-ramps\" to careers in their mid-40s. Honestly, I'm not sure what to tell most of them. Unlike the pioneering women who entered the workforce after having children in the 1970s, these women are competing with their younger selves. Government and NGO jobs are an option, but many careers are effectively closed off. Personally, I have never seen a woman in her 40s enter the academic market successfully, or enter a law firm as a junior associate, Alicia Florrick of The Good Wife notwithstanding.",
"These considerations are why so many career women of my generation chose to establish themselves in their careers first and have children in their mid-to-late 30s. But that raises the possibility of spending long, stressful years and a small fortune trying to have a baby. I lived that nightmare: for three years, beginning at age 35, I did everything possible to conceive and was frantic at the thought that I had simply left having a biological child until it was too late.",
"And when everything does work out? I had my first child at 38 (and counted myself blessed) and my second at 40. That means I will be 58 when both of my children are out of the house. What's more, it means that many peak career opportunities are coinciding precisely with their teenage years, when, experienced parents advise, being available as a parent is just as important as in the first years of a child's life.",
"Many women of my generation have found themselves, in the prime of their careers, saying no to opportunities they once would have jumped at and hoping those chances come around again later. Many others who have decided to step back for a while, taking on consultant positions or part-time work that lets them spend more time with their children (or aging parents), are worrying about how long they can \"stay out\" before they lose the competitive edge they worked so hard to acquire.",
"Given the way our work culture is oriented today, I recommend establishing yourself in your career first but still trying to have kids before you are 35—or else freeze your eggs, whether you are married or not. You may well be a more mature and less frustrated parent in your 30s or 40s; you are also more likely to have found a lasting life partner. But the truth is, neither sequence is optimal, and both involve trade-offs that men do not have to make.",
"You should be able to have a family if you want one—however and whenever your life circumstances allow—and still have the career you desire. If more women could strike this balance, more women would reach leadership positions. And if more women were in leadership positions, they could make it easier for more women to stay in the workforce. The rest of this essay details how.",
"Changing the Culture of Face Time",
"Back in the Reagan administration, a New York Times story about the ferociously competitive budget director Dick Darman reported, \"Mr. Darman sometimes managed to convey the impression that he was the last one working in the Reagan White House by leaving his suit coat on his chair and his office light burning after he left for home.\" (Darman claimed that it was just easier to leave his suit jacket in the office so he could put it on again in the morning, but his record of psychological manipulation suggests otherwise.)",
"The culture of \"time macho\"—a relentless competition to work harder, stay later, pull more all-nighters, travel around the world and bill the extra hours that the international date line affords you—remains astonishingly prevalent among professionals today. Nothing captures the belief that more time equals more value better than the cult of billable hours afflicting large law firms across the country and providing exactly the wrong incentives for employees who hope to integrate work and family. Yet even in industries that don't explicitly reward sheer quantity of hours spent on the job, the pressure to arrive early, stay late, and be available, always, for in-person meetings at 11 a.m. on Saturdays can be intense. Indeed, by some measures, the problem has gotten worse over time: a study by the Center for American Progress reports that nationwide, the share of all professionals—women and men—working more than 50 hours a week has increased since the late 1970s.",
"But more time in the office does not always mean more \"value added\"—and it does not always add up to a more successful organization. In 2009, Sandra Pocharski, a senior female partner at Monitor Group and the head of the firm's Leadership and Organization practice, commissioned a Harvard Business School professor to assess the factors that helped or hindered women's effectiveness and advancement at Monitor. The study found that the company's culture was characterized by an \"always on\" mode of working, often without due regard to the impact on employees. Pocharski observed:",
"Clients come first, always, and sometimes burning the midnight oil really does make the difference between success and failure. But sometimes we were just defaulting to behavior that overloaded our people without improving results much, if at all. We decided we needed managers to get better at distinguishing between these categories, and to recognize the hidden costs of assuming that \"time is cheap.\" When that time doesn't add a lot of value and comes at a high cost to talented employees, who will leave when the personal cost becomes unsustainable—well, that is clearly a bad outcome for everyone.",
"I have worked very long hours and pulled plenty of all-nighters myself over the course of my career, including a few nights on my office couch during my two years in D.C. Being willing to put the time in when the job simply has to get done is rightfully a hallmark of a successful professional. But looking back, I have to admit that my assumption that I would stay late made me much less efficient over the course of the day than I might have been, and certainly less so than some of my colleagues, who managed to get the same amount of work done and go home at a decent hour. If Dick Darman had had a boss who clearly valued prioritization and time management, he might have found reason to turn out the lights and take his jacket home.",
"Long hours are one thing, and realistically, they are often unavoidable. But do they really need to be spent at the office? To be sure, being in the office some of the time is beneficial. In-person meetings can be far more efficient than phone or e-mail tag; trust and collegiality are much more easily built up around the same physical table; and spontaneous conversations often generate good ideas and lasting relationships. Still, armed with e-mail, instant messaging, phones, and videoconferencing technology, we should be able to move to a culture where the office is a base of operations more than the required locus of work.",
"Being able to work from home—in the evening after children are put to bed, or during their sick days or snow days, and at least some of the time on weekends—can be the key, for mothers, to carrying your full load versus letting a team down at crucial moments. State-of-the-art videoconferencing facilities can dramatically reduce the need for long business trips. These technologies are making inroads, and allowing easier integration of work and family life. According to the Women's Business Center, 61 percent of women business owners use technology to \"integrate the responsibilities of work and home\"; 44 percent use technology to allow employees \"to work off-site or to have flexible work schedules.\" Yet our work culture still remains more office-centered than it needs to be, especially in light of technological advances.",
"One way to change that is by changing the \"default rules\" that govern office work—the baseline expectations about when, where, and how work will be done. As behavioral economists well know, these baselines can make an enormous difference in the way people act. It is one thing, for instance, for an organization to allow phone-ins to a meeting on an ad hoc basis, when parenting and work schedules collide—a system that's better than nothing, but likely to engender guilt among those calling in, and possibly resentment among those in the room. It is quite another for that organization to declare that its policy will be to schedule in-person meetings, whenever possible, during the hours of the school day—a system that might normalize call-ins for those (rarer) meetings still held in the late afternoon.",
"One real-world example comes from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a place most people are more likely to associate with distinguished gentlemen in pinstripes than with progressive thinking about work-family balance. Like so many other places, however, the FCO worries about losing talented members of two-career couples around the world, particularly women. So it recently changed its basic policy from a default rule that jobs have to be done on-site to one that assumes that some jobs might be done remotely, and invites workers to make the case for remote work. Kara Owen, a career foreign-service officer who was the FCO's diversity director and will soon become the British deputy ambassador to France, writes that she has now done two remote jobs. Before her current maternity leave, she was working a London job from Dublin to be with her partner, using teleconferencing technology and timing her trips to London to coincide \"with key meetings where I needed to be in the room (or chatting at the pre-meeting coffee) to have an impact, or to do intensive 'network maintenance.'\" In fact, she writes, \"I have found the distance and quiet to be a real advantage in a strategic role, providing I have put in the investment up front to develop very strong personal relationships with the game changers.\" Owen recognizes that not every job can be done this way. But she says that for her part, she has been able to combine family requirements with her career.",
"Changes in default office rules should not advantage parents over other workers; indeed, done right, they can improve relations among co-workers by raising their awareness of each other's circumstances and instilling a sense of fairness. Two years ago, the ACLU Foundation of Massachusetts decided to replace its \"parental leave\" policy with a \"family leave\" policy that provides for as much as 12 weeks of leave not only for new parents, but also for employees who need to care for a spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condition. According to Director Carol Rose, \"We wanted a policy that took into account the fact that even employees who do not have children have family obligations.\" The policy was shaped by the belief that giving women \"special treatment\" can \"backfire if the broader norms shaping the behavior of all employees do not change.\" When I was the dean of the Wilson School, I managed with the mantra \"Family comes first\"—any family—and found that my employees were both productive and intensely loyal.",
"None of these changes will happen by themselves, and reasons to avoid them will seldom be hard to find. But obstacles and inertia are usually surmountable if leaders are open to changing their assumptions about the workplace. The use of technology in many high-level government jobs, for instance, is complicated by the need to have access to classified information. But in 2009, Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, who shares the parenting of his two young daughters equally with his wife, made getting such access at home an immediate priority so that he could leave the office at a reasonable hour and participate in important meetings via videoconferencing if necessary. I wonder how many women in similar positions would be afraid to ask, lest they be seen as insufficiently committed to their jobs.",
"Revaluing Family Values",
"While employers shouldn't privilege parents over other workers, too often they end up doing the opposite, usually subtly, and usually in ways that make it harder for a primary caregiver to get ahead. Many people in positions of power seem to place a low value on child care in comparison with other outside activities. Consider the following proposition: An employer has two equally talented and productive employees. One trains for and runs marathons when he is not working. The other takes care of two children. What assumptions is the employer likely to make about the marathon runner? That he gets up in the dark every day and logs an hour or two running before even coming into the office, or drives himself to get out there even after a long day. That he is ferociously disciplined and willing to push himself through distraction, exhaustion, and days when nothing seems to go right in the service of a goal far in the distance. That he must manage his time exceptionally well to squeeze all of that in.",
"Be honest: Do you think the employer makes those same assumptions about the parent? Even though she likely rises in the dark hours before she needs to be at work, organizes her children's day, makes breakfast, packs lunch, gets them off to school, figures out shopping and other errands even if she is lucky enough to have a housekeeper—and does much the same work at the end of the day. Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's indefatigable chief of staff, has twins in elementary school; even with a fully engaged husband, she famously gets up at four every morning to check and send e-mails before her kids wake up. Louise Richardson, now the vice chancellor of the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland, combined an assistant professorship in government at Harvard with mothering three young children. She organized her time so ruthlessly that she always keyed in 1:11 or 2:22 or 3:33 on the microwave rather than 1:00, 2:00, or 3:00, because hitting the same number three times took less time.",
"Elizabeth Warren, who is now running for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, has a similar story. When she had two young children and a part-time law practice, she struggled to find enough time to write the papers and articles that would help get her an academic position. In her words:",
"I needed a plan. I figured out that writing time was when Alex was asleep. So the minute I put him down for a nap or he fell asleep in the baby swing, I went to my desk and started working on something—footnotes, reading, outlining, writing … I learned to do everything else with a baby on my hip.",
"The discipline, organization, and sheer endurance it takes to succeed at top levels with young children at home is easily comparable to running 20 to 40 miles a week. But that's rarely how employers see things, not only when making allowances, but when making promotions. Perhaps because people choose to have children? People also choose to run marathons.",
"One final example: I have worked with many Orthodox Jewish men who observed the Sabbath from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday. Jack Lew, the two-time director of the Office of Management and Budget, former deputy secretary of state for management and resources, and now White House chief of staff, is a case in point. Jack's wife lived in New York when he worked in the State Department, so he would leave the office early enough on Friday afternoon to take the shuttle to New York and a taxi to his apartment before sundown. He would not work on Friday after sundown or all day Saturday. Everyone who knew him, including me, admired his commitment to his faith and his ability to carve out the time for it, even with an enormously demanding job.",
"It is hard to imagine, however, that we would have the same response if a mother told us she was blocking out mid-Friday afternoon through the end of the day on Saturday, every week, to spend time with her children. I suspect this would be seen as unprofessional, an imposition of unnecessary costs on co-workers. In fact, of course, one of the great values of the Sabbath—whether Jewish or Christian—is precisely that it carves out a family oasis, with rituals and a mandatory setting-aside of work.",
"Our assumptions are just that: things we believe that are not necessarily so. Yet what we assume has an enormous impact on our perceptions and responses. Fortunately, changing our assumptions is up to us.",
"Redefining the Arc of a Successful Career",
"The American definition of a successful professional is someone who can climb the ladder the furthest in the shortest time, generally peaking between ages 45 and 55. It is a definition well suited to the mid-20th century, an era when people had kids in their 20s, stayed in one job, retired at 67, and were dead, on average, by age 71.",
"It makes far less sense today. Average life expectancy for people in their 20s has increased to 80; men and women in good health can easily work until they are 75. They can expect to have multiple jobs and even multiple careers throughout their working life. Couples marry later, have kids later, and can expect to live on two incomes. They may well retire earlier—the average retirement age has gone down from 67 to 63—but that is commonly \"retirement\" only in the sense of collecting retirement benefits. Many people go on to \"encore\" careers.",
"Assuming the priceless gifts of good health and good fortune, a professional woman can thus expect her working life to stretch some 50 years, from her early or mid-20s to her mid-70s. It is reasonable to assume that she will build her credentials and establish herself, at least in her first career, between 22 and 35; she will have children, if she wants them, sometime between 25 and 45; she'll want maximum flexibility and control over her time in the 10 years that her children are 8 to 18; and she should plan to take positions of maximum authority and demands on her time after her children are out of the house. Women who have children in their late 20s can expect to immerse themselves completely in their careers in their late 40s, with plenty of time still to rise to the top in their late 50s and early 60s. Women who make partner, managing director, or senior vice president; get tenure; or establish a medical practice before having children in their late 30s should be coming back on line for the most demanding jobs at almost exactly the same age.",
"Along the way, women should think about the climb to leadership not in terms of a straight upward slope, but as irregular stair steps, with periodic plateaus (and even dips) when they turn down promotions to remain in a job that works for their family situation; when they leave high-powered jobs and spend a year or two at home on a reduced schedule; or when they step off a conventional professional track to take a consulting position or project-based work for a number of years. I think of these plateaus as \"investment intervals.\" My husband and I took a sabbatical in Shanghai, from August 2007 to May 2008, right in the thick of an election year when many of my friends were advising various candidates on foreign-policy issues. We thought of the move in part as \"putting money in the family bank,\" taking advantage of the opportunity to spend a close year together in a foreign culture. But we were also investing in our children's ability to learn Mandarin and in our own knowledge of Asia.",
"Peaking in your late 50s and early 60s rather than your late 40s and early 50s makes particular sense for women, who live longer than men. And many of the stereotypes about older workers simply do not hold. A 2006 survey of human-resources professionals shows that only 23 percent think older workers are less flexible than younger workers; only 11 percent think older workers require more training than younger workers; and only 7 percent think older workers have less drive than younger workers.",
"Whether women will really have the confidence to stair-step their careers, however, will again depend in part on perceptions. Slowing down the rate of promotions, taking time out periodically, pursuing an alternative path during crucial parenting or parent-care years—all have to become more visible and more noticeably accepted as a pause rather than an opt-out. (In an encouraging sign, Mass Career Customization, a 2007 book by Cathleen Benko and Anne Weisberg arguing that \"today's career is no longer a straight climb up the corporate ladder, but rather a combination of climbs, lateral moves, and planned descents,\" was a Wall Street Journal best seller.)",
"Institutions can also take concrete steps to promote this acceptance. For instance, in 1970, Princeton established a tenure-extension policy that allowed female assistant professors expecting a child to request a one-year extension on their tenure clocks. This policy was later extended to men, and broadened to include adoptions. In the early 2000s, two reports on the status of female faculty discovered that only about 3 percent of assistant professors requested tenure extensions in a given year. And in response to a survey question, women were much more likely than men to think that a tenure extension would be detrimental to an assistant professor's career.",
"So in 2005, under President Shirley Tilghman, Princeton changed the default rule. The administration announced that all assistant professors, female and male, who had a new child would automatically receive a one-year extension on the tenure clock, with no opt-outs allowed. Instead, assistant professors could request early consideration for tenure if they wished. The number of assistant professors who receive a tenure extension has tripled since the change.",
"One of the best ways to move social norms in this direction is to choose and celebrate different role models. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and I are poles apart politically, but he went way up in my estimation when he announced that one reason he decided against running for president in 2012 was the impact his campaign would have had on his children. He reportedly made clear at a fund-raiser in Louisiana that he didn't want to be away from his children for long periods of time; according to a Republican official at the event, he said that \"his son [missed] him after being gone for the three days on the road, and that he needed to get back.\" He may not get my vote if and when he does run for president, but he definitely gets my admiration (providing he doesn't turn around and join the GOP ticket this fall).",
"If we are looking for high-profile female role models, we might begin with Michelle Obama. She started out with the same résumé as her husband, but has repeatedly made career decisions designed to let her do work she cared about and also be the kind of parent she wanted to be. She moved from a high-powered law firm first to Chicago city government and then to the University of Chicago shortly before her daughters were born, a move that let her work only 10 minutes away from home. She has spoken publicly and often about her initial concerns that her husband's entry into politics would be bad for their family life, and about her determination to limit her participation in the presidential election campaign to have more time at home. Even as first lady, she has been adamant that she be able to balance her official duties with family time. We should see her as a full-time career woman, but one who is taking a very visible investment interval. We should celebrate her not only as a wife, mother, and champion of healthy eating, but also as a woman who has had the courage and judgment to invest in her daughters when they need her most. And we should expect a glittering career from her after she leaves the White House and her daughters leave for college.",
"Rediscovering the Pursuit of Happiness",
"One of the most complicated and surprising parts of my journey out of Washington was coming to grips with what I really wanted. I had opportunities to stay on, and I could have tried to work out an arrangement allowing me to spend more time at home. I might have been able to get my family to join me in Washington for a year; I might have been able to get classified technology installed at my house the way Jim Steinberg did; I might have been able to commute only four days a week instead of five. (While this last change would have still left me very little time at home, given the intensity of my job, it might have made the job doable for another year or two.) But I realized that I didn't just need to go home. Deep down, I wanted to go home. I wanted to be able to spend time with my children in the last few years that they are likely to live at home, crucial years for their development into responsible, productive, happy, and caring adults. But also irreplaceable years for me to enjoy the simple pleasures of parenting—baseball games, piano recitals, waffle breakfasts, family trips, and goofy rituals. My older son is doing very well these days, but even when he gives us a hard time, as all teenagers do, being home to shape his choices and help him make good decisions is deeply satisfying.",
"The flip side of my realization is captured in Macko and Rubin's ruminations on the importance of bringing the different parts of their lives together as 30-year-old women:",
"If we didn't start to learn how to integrate our personal, social, and professional lives, we were about five years away from morphing into the angry woman on the other side of a mahogany desk who questions her staff's work ethic after standard 12-hour workdays, before heading home to eat moo shoo pork in her lonely apartment.",
"Women have contributed to the fetish of the one-dimensional life, albeit by necessity. The pioneer generation of feminists walled off their personal lives from their professional personas to ensure that they could never be discriminated against for a lack of commitment to their work. When I was a law student in the 1980s, many women who were then climbing the legal hierarchy in New York firms told me that they never admitted to taking time out for a child's doctor appointment or school performance, but instead invented a much more neutral excuse.",
"Today, however, women in power can and should change that environment, although change is not easy. When I became dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, in 2002, I decided that one of the advantages of being a woman in power was that I could help change the norms by deliberately talking about my children and my desire to have a balanced life. Thus, I would end faculty meetings at 6 p.m. by saying that I had to go home for dinner; I would also make clear to all student organizations that I would not come to dinner with them, because I needed to be home from six to eight, but that I would often be willing to come back after eight for a meeting. I also once told the Dean's Advisory Committee that the associate dean would chair the next session so I could go to a parent-teacher conference.",
"After a few months of this, several female assistant professors showed up in my office quite agitated. \"You have to stop talking about your kids,\" one said. \"You are not showing the gravitas that people expect from a dean, which is particularly damaging precisely because you are the first woman dean of the school.\" I told them that I was doing it deliberately and continued my practice, but it is interesting that gravitas and parenthood don't seem to go together.",
"Ten years later, whenever I am introduced at a lecture or other speaking engagement, I insist that the person introducing me mention that I have two sons. It seems odd to me to list degrees, awards, positions, and interests and not include the dimension of my life that is most important to me—and takes an enormous amount of my time. As Secretary Clinton once said in a television interview in Beijing when the interviewer asked her about Chelsea's upcoming wedding: \"That's my real life.\" But I notice that my male introducers are typically uncomfortable when I make the request. They frequently say things like \"And she particularly wanted me to mention that she has two sons\"—thereby drawing attention to the unusual nature of my request, when my entire purpose is to make family references routine and normal in professional life.",
"This does not mean that you should insist that your colleagues spend time cooing over pictures of your baby or listening to the prodigious accomplishments of your kindergartner. It does mean that if you are late coming in one week, because it is your turn to drive the kids to school, that you be honest about what you are doing. Indeed, Sheryl Sandberg recently acknowledged not only that she leaves work at 5:30 to have dinner with her family, but also that for many years she did not dare make this admission, even though she would of course make up the work time later in the evening. Her willingness to speak out now is a strong step in the right direction.",
"Seeking out a more balanced life is not a women's issue; balance would be better for us all. Bronnie Ware, an Australian blogger who worked for years in palliative care and is the author of the 2011 book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, writes that the regret she heard most often was \"I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.\" The second-most-common regret was \"I wish I didn't work so hard.\" She writes: \"This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's youth and their partner's companionship.\"",
"Juliette Kayyem, who several years ago left the Department of Homeland Security soon after her husband, David Barron, left a high position in the Justice Department, says their joint decision to leave Washington and return to Boston sprang from their desire to work on the \"happiness project,\" meaning quality time with their three children. (She borrowed the term from her friend Gretchen Rubin, who wrote a best-selling book and now runs a blog with that name.)",
"It's time to embrace a national happiness project. As a daughter of Charlottesville, Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson and the university he founded, I grew up with the Declaration of Independence in my blood. Last I checked, he did not declare American independence in the name of life, liberty, and professional success. Let us rediscover the pursuit of happiness, and let us start at home.",
"Innovation Nation",
"As I write this, I can hear the reaction of some readers to many of the proposals in this essay: It's all fine and well for a tenured professor to write about flexible working hours, investment intervals, and family-comes-first management. But what about the real world? Most American women cannot demand these things, particularly in a bad economy, and their employers have little incentive to grant them voluntarily. Indeed, the most frequent reaction I get in putting forth these ideas is that when the choice is whether to hire a man who will work whenever and wherever needed, or a woman who needs more flexibility, choosing the man will add more value to the company.",
"In fact, while many of these issues are hard to quantify and measure precisely, the statistics seem to tell a different story. A seminal study of 527 U.S. companies, published in the Academy of Management Journal in 2000, suggests that \"organizations with more extensive work-family policies have higher perceived firm-level performance\" among their industry peers. These findings accorded with a 2003 study conducted by Michelle Arthur at the University of New Mexico. Examining 130 announcements of family-friendly policies in The Wall Street Journal, Arthur found that the announcements alone significantly improved share prices. In 2011, a study on flexibility in the workplace by Ellen Galinsky, Kelly Sakai, and Tyler Wigton of the Families and Work Institute showed that increased flexibility correlates positively with job engagement, job satisfaction, employee retention, and employee health.",
"This is only a small sampling from a large and growing literature trying to pin down the relationship between family-friendly policies and economic performance. Other scholars have concluded that good family policies attract better talent, which in turn raises productivity, but that the policies themselves have no impact on productivity. Still others argue that results attributed to these policies are actually a function of good management overall. What is evident, however, is that many firms that recruit and train well-educated professional women are aware that when a woman leaves because of bad work-family balance, they are losing the money and time they invested in her.",
"Even the legal industry, built around the billable hour, is taking notice. Deborah Epstein Henry, a former big-firm litigator, is now the president of Flex-Time Lawyers, a national consulting firm focused partly on strategies for the retention of female attorneys. In her book Law and Reorder, published by the American Bar Association in 2010, she describes a legal profession \"where the billable hour no longer works\"; where attorneys, judges, recruiters, and academics all agree that this system of compensation has perverted the industry, leading to brutal work hours, massive inefficiency, and highly inflated costs. The answer—already being deployed in different corners of the industry—is a combination of alternative fee structures, virtual firms, women-owned firms, and the outsourcing of discrete legal jobs to other jurisdictions. Women, and Generation X and Y lawyers more generally, are pushing for these changes on the supply side; clients determined to reduce legal fees and increase flexible service are pulling on the demand side. Slowly, change is happening.",
"At the core of all this is self-interest. Losing smart and motivated women not only diminishes a company's talent pool; it also reduces the return on its investment in training and mentoring. In trying to address these issues, some firms are finding out that women's ways of working may just be better ways of working, for employees and clients alike.",
"Experts on creativity and innovation emphasize the value of encouraging nonlinear thinking and cultivating randomness by taking long walks or looking at your environment from unusual angles. In their new book, A New Culture of Learning: Cultivating the Imagination for a World of Constant Change, the innovation gurus John Seely Brown and Douglas Thomas write, \"We believe that connecting play and imagination may be the single most important step in unleashing the new culture of learning.\"",
"Space for play and imagination is exactly what emerges when rigid work schedules and hierarchies loosen up. Skeptics should consider the \"California effect.\" California is the cradle of American innovation—in technology, entertainment, sports, food, and lifestyles. It is also a place where people take leisure as seriously as they take work; where companies like Google deliberately encourage play, with Ping-Pong tables, light sabers, and policies that require employees to spend one day a week working on whatever they wish. Charles Baudelaire wrote: \"Genius is nothing more nor less than childhood recovered at will.\" Google apparently has taken note.",
"No parent would mistake child care for childhood. Still, seeing the world anew through a child's eyes can be a powerful source of stimulation. When the Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling wrote The Strategy of Conflict, a classic text applying game theory to conflicts among nations, he frequently drew on child-rearing for examples of when deterrence might succeed or fail. \"It may be easier to articulate the peculiar difficulty of constraining [a ruler] by the use of threats,\" he wrote, \"when one is fresh from a vain attempt at using threats to keep a small child from hurting a dog or a small dog from hurting a child.\"",
"The books I've read with my children, the silly movies I've watched, the games I've played, questions I've answered, and people I've met while parenting have broadened my world. Another axiom of the literature on innovation is that the more often people with different perspectives come together, the more likely creative ideas are to emerge. Giving workers the ability to integrate their non-work lives with their work—whether they spend that time mothering or marathoning—will open the door to a much wider range of influences and ideas.",
"Enlisting Men",
"Perhaps the most encouraging news of all for achieving the sorts of changes that I have proposed is that men are joining the cause. In commenting on a draft of this article, Martha Minow, the dean of the Harvard Law School, wrote me that one change she has observed during 30 years of teaching law at Harvard is that today many young men are asking questions about how they can manage a work-life balance. And more systematic research on Generation Y confirms that many more men than in the past are asking questions about how they are going to integrate active parenthood with their professional lives.",
"Abstract aspirations are easier than concrete trade-offs, of course. These young men have not yet faced the question of whether they are prepared to give up that more prestigious clerkship or fellowship, decline a promotion, or delay their professional goals to spend more time with their children and to support their partner's career.",
"Yet once work practices and work culture begin to evolve, those changes are likely to carry their own momentum. Kara Owen, the British foreign-service officer who worked a London job from Dublin, wrote me in an e-mail:",
"I think the culture on flexible working started to change the minute the Board of Management (who were all men at the time) started to work flexibly—quite a few of them started working one day a week from home.",
"Men have, of course, become much more involved parents over the past couple of decades, and that, too, suggests broad support for big changes in the way we balance work and family. It is noteworthy that both James Steinberg, deputy secretary of state, and William Lynn, deputy secretary of defense, stepped down two years into the Obama administration so that they could spend more time with their children (for real).",
"Going forward, women would do well to frame work-family balance in terms of the broader social and economic issues that affect both women and men. After all, we have a new generation of young men who have been raised by full-time working mothers. Let us presume, as I do with my sons, that they will understand \"supporting their families\" to mean more than earning money.",
"I HAVE BEEN BLESSED to work with and be mentored by some extraordinary women. Watching Hillary Clinton in action makes me incredibly proud—of her intelligence, expertise, professionalism, charisma, and command of any audience. I get a similar rush when I see a front-page picture of Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, deep in conversation about some of the most important issues on the world stage; or of Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, standing up forcefully for the Syrian people in the Security Council.",
"These women are extraordinary role models. If I had a daughter, I would encourage her to look to them, and I want a world in which they are extraordinary but not unusual. Yet I also want a world in which, in Lisa Jackson's words, \"to be a strong woman, you don't have to give up on the things that define you as a woman.\" That means respecting, enabling, and indeed celebrating the full range of women's choices. \"Empowering yourself,\" Jackson said in her speech at Princeton, \"doesn't have to mean rejecting motherhood, or eliminating the nurturing or feminine aspects of who you are.\"",
"I gave a speech at Vassar last November and arrived in time to wander the campus on a lovely fall afternoon. It is a place infused with a spirit of community and generosity, filled with benches, walkways, public art, and quiet places donated by alumnae seeking to encourage contemplation and connection. Turning the pages of the alumni magazine (Vassar is now coed), I was struck by the entries of older alumnae, who greeted their classmates with Salve (Latin for \"hello\") and wrote witty remembrances sprinkled with literary allusions. Theirs was a world in which women wore their learning lightly; their news is mostly of their children's accomplishments. Many of us look back on that earlier era as a time when it was fine to joke that women went to college to get an \"M.R.S.\" And many women of my generation abandoned the Seven Sisters as soon as the formerly all-male Ivy League universities became coed. I would never return to the world of segregated sexes and rampant discrimination. But now is the time to revisit the assumption that women must rush to adapt to the \"man's world\" that our mothers and mentors warned us about.",
"I continually push the young women in my classes to speak more. They must gain the confidence to value their own insights and questions, and to present them readily. My husband agrees, but he actually tries to get the young men in his classes to act more like the women—to speak less and listen more. If women are ever to achieve real equality as leaders, then we have to stop accepting male behavior and male choices as the default and the ideal. We must insist on changing social policies and bending career tracks to accommodate our choices, too. We have the power to do it if we decide to, and we have many men standing beside us.",
"We'll create a better society in the process, for all women. We may need to put a woman in the White House before we are able to change the conditions of the women working at Walmart. But when we do, we will stop talking about whether women can have it all. We will properly focus on how we can help all Americans have healthy, happy, productive lives, valuing the people they love as much as the success they seek.",

			"headline": "The other week I watched 70 hours of TED talks; short, 18-minute talks given by inspirational leaders in the fields of Technology,Entertainment, and Design (TED).",
			"contents": [
"The other week I watched 70 hours of TED talks; short, 18-minute talks given by inspirational leaders in the fields of Technology,Entertainment, and Design (TED). I watched 296 talks in total, and I recently went through the list of what I watched, weeded out the crappy and boring talks, and created a list of the 100 best things I learned !",
"This article isn't entirely about productivity, but I guarantee you'll learn a thing or two. Here are 100 incredible things I learned watching 70 hours of TED talks last week!",
"Productivity",
"1. Studies have shown that what motivates a person the most (in non-factory-type work) is how much autonomy, mastery, and purpose they have, not how much money they make.",
"2. Playing video games can actually make you more productive because video games give you more physical, mental, emotional, and social resilience.",
"3. A lot of people aspire to be productive so they can become happier, but happiness has been shown to lead to productivity, not the other way around.",
"4. You don't have as much attention to give to the world around you as you think. You can't recall memories while processing new data, you can only process so much information at once, and your attention is easily manipulated (like by magicians).",
"5. Innovative thinking is often a slow and gradual process, not a moment of instant, lightbulb-like inspiration.",
"6. If you want people to remember you, sweat the small stuff. Most companies (and people) do the big stuff right, so sweating the small stuff (like getting the user interfaces on your products right) can really set you apart.",
"7. You have three brain systems for love: lust, romantic love, and attachment. To develop more intimate relationships with your significant other, it's important to invest in all three.",
"8. When you create an environment for your employees that makes them truly happy(instead of just rich), more profits may follow.",
"9. Your office is actually a pretty crappy environment to get work done. In fact, when Jason Fried asked folks where their favorite place to get work done was, almost no one said \"in the office\".",
"10. Taking time off can make you a lot more productive, because time away from your work lets you explore, reflect, and come up with better ideas.",
"11. The greatest leaders and companies constantly reflect on why they do what they do, instead of simply doing it.",
"12. Success isn't a destination, it's a continuous journey that's made up of eight parts: passion, hard work, focus, pushing yourself and others, having great ideas, making constant improvements, serving others, and persistence.",
"13. The key to becoming more productive and successful may be to fail faster and smarter, especially if you do creative work.",
"14. We don't feel fear because of a potential loss of income or status, we feel fear because we're afraid of being judged and ridiculed. Any vision of success has to admit what the definition doesn't include, and what you may be missing out on.",
"15. IQ isn't the only thing that dictates whether someone will be successful or unsuccessful; grit does too.",
"16. If you want to make better long-term decisions, imagine how your decisions will affect your future-self.",
"17. All you have to do to learn practically anything is jump in and ask yourself, \"what's the worst that could happen?\"",
"18. People tend to avoid conflict (it's in our nature), even though a moderate level of conflict may be the key to better relationships, research, and businesses.",
"19. Mass media is pretty much dead, so the key to making big changes is through tribes. As time goes on, more and more people are investing their time and attention in their tribes (like TED!)",
"20. The best way to help someone is often to shut up and listen to them.",
"21. A great way to kill two birds with one stone: have walking meetings, where you walk and talk to someone at the same time. It's great exercise, and it speeds up the meeting.",
"22. Stress by itself doesn't affect your health. How you think about stress does.",
"Here are three other productivity experiments I've done recently: Meditating for 35 hours over 7 days; using my smartphone for only an hour a day for three months; living in total reclusion for 10 days.",
"More TED Talks lessons: Speak like a Pro- 15 lessons learned from watching TED TALKS",
"Becoming a better human",
"23, 24, 25. Limits are bullshit. Some people choose to not be set back by limits, and at the end of the day, they're the ones who end up giving TED talks. Like Neil Harbisson, who was born without the ability to see color, so he hacked together a device to hear color. Or Caroline Casey, who didn't learn until she was 17 that she was legally blind. Or David Blaine, who pushed his body and mind to hold his breath for 17 straight minutes underwater.",
"26. Don't worry – texting isn't ruining your understanding of the English language.",
"27. You're not as rational as you think you are. One example: do you supersize your meal at McDonald's even when you're not hungry?",
"28. Three keys to success from Elon Musk: Work very hard, pay attention to negative feedback (especially when it comes from friends), and study physics to learn how to reason from first principles (instead of by analogy).",
"29. If you're arguing with someone to win the argument, you're doing it for the wrong reasons.You should be arguing to learn.",
"30. Like it or not, your body language affects how other people think of you.",
"31. Great, committed sex combines two things: your need for security, and your need for surprise.",
"32. Being introverted isn't a bad thing; it's quite the opposite! Even though society often seems to value extraverts more, introverts should be celebrated just as much.",
"33. To save more money, commit to saving more money, tomorrow.",
"34. Living an awesome life means having a great attitude (seeing the good in things), seeing the wonder in the world around you, and being authentic.",
"35, 36, 37, 38, 39. 40, 41. There isn't one secret to happiness, but there are a lot of small secrets that will move you in the right direction. Stay in the moment, and be mindful. Spend money on other people, rather than on yourself. Slow down. Take time to appreciate and see the good in what you have. Live a life that's full of meaning in the short-and long-term. And change how you look at the past, present, and future.",
"42. Your memory is a lot faultier than you think. You frequently remember things that didn't happen, and remember things differently than they actually happened. Plus, your memories can be manipulated.",
"People",
"43. When it comes to classical music, no one is tone-deaf, and almost anyone can be calmed or inspired by classical music.",
"44. The people who design book covers actually put a ton of thought (and art) into their designs.",
"45. The biggest killer in America isn't cancer, it's obesity. 66% of the U.S. is obese, including a lot of children and teens, and 1 in 4 people in America dies of a preventable, food-related disease.",
"46. Schools kill creativity, and the education model we teach kids by is significantly outdated. School should nurture, not undermine creativity, which Ken Robinson argues that it does.",
"47. Students learn best when you make them stop and think, and bring classroom problems down to earth.",
"48. There is a large difference between unconditional love and unconditional acceptance, and just because you are loved doesn't mean you are accepted.",
"49. People are powerful. They stand up to soldiers, show compassion when it seems impossible, and expose their vulnerability when it's the most difficult.",
"50. Monkeys make the same stupid mistakes with money that people do, so our irrationality may just be rooted in our evolutionary history.",
"51. Depression (and other diseases) can strike anyone, anytime. Including a comic who has basically everything going for him.",
"52. North Korea is one of the most terrible and gruesome places to grow up. Citizens of the country frequently starve to death, are victim to military violence, and are shot if they try to escape.",
"53. Violence against women isn't a \"women's issue\", it's a man's issue that's rooted in the way men view women.",
"54. One of the most effective ways to cure poverty in developing countries isn't food, cattle, or anything else – it's giving away cellphones.",
"55. Every day, homeless people are completely ignored, abused, and made to feel invisible.Take it from someone who used to be homeless.",
"56. According to data, women \"systematically underestimate their own abilities\", particularly at work. According to Cheryl Sandberg, women need to sit at the table, make their partner a real partner, and not \"leave before they leave\" (step back from opportunities because of their family life).",
"57. Some of the best designs not only look great, but also accommodate your other four senses. They should also feel great, sound great, smell great, and even taste great.",
"58. We live in the one of the most peaceful times of humanity's existence, even though it might not seem that way. This talk has the fascinating stats to back that up.",
"59, 60. Good design has the potential to make people incredibly happy. And some of the best designs are the ones that tell stories.",
"61. A little danger is good for both kids and grown-ups, and it makes you into a more versatile, well-rounded person.",
"62. If you want to help people in developing countries, you better have a deep understanding of the values of who you're helping. Take it from a condom saleswoman in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
"63. There may be another way to run a successful, modern economy: the Chinese way. Even if you disagree, this talk is fascinating (it's given from a Chinese perspective).",
"64. The language you speak affects your ability to save money. Studies have shown that languages that are more future-oriented motivate people to save more money.",
"65. Hard work is sometimes degraded in society, but unjustifiably so. According to Mike Rowe (the host of Dirty Jobs), hard work is worth it.",
"66. The way we think about charity is dead-wrong. We reward charities for how little money they spend, instead of for the difference they actually make.",
"67. \"Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change\", and it's one of the most powerful qualities you have.",
"68. 4 a.m. is the most mysterious hour of the day.",
"69. 30 is not the new 20. Some people see their 20′s as a throwaway decade, even though it's one of the most formative decades of a person's life.",
"70, 71. Additional choice can make people either happier or less happy. Choice can make someone happy when the choices legitimately suit their needs better, and it can make someone less happy when it makes them more paralyzed (which happens a lot more than you think).",
"A Year of Productivity is my full-time job for a whole year, and I have no ads on the site. If you find what I make valuable, please pitch in a few bucks! You don't have to any means, and I hate asking for money, but it truly helps me build my site up and pay the bills. Here are 8 awesome reasons to pitch in!",
"Technology",
"72. It turns out you can use two slices of pizza as a slide clicker, make music with ketchup, and make a piano keyboard with a banana!",
"73. If your medical data could anonymously be used by any researcher seeking a hypothesis, there would be a \"wave of healthcare innovation\".",
"74. Since more and more websites are trying to tailor their content to you, you may get caught up in a digital \"filter bubble\" and not get \"exposed to information that could challenge or broaden [your] worldview\".",
"75. There is a camera that shoots video at a trillion frames a second, and the results are incredible.",
"76. Google is working on a car that drives itself, and it actually works very well.",
"77. A trend to watch: 3D printing. The ability for you to be able to print 3D items at home isn't that far away.",
"78. Incredible things happen when you create an open encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Here's the story behind Wikipedia.",
"79. There are a lot of videos about cats and twerking, but web video is also an incredible tool for learning and global innovation.",
"80. Everywhere you go online, you're tracked; a lot more than you might suspect. Web tracking isn't 100% evil, but websites certainly track you a ton, so it's worth informing yourself what they use that information for.",
"81. Every electronic device you own is incredibly complex, with parts sourced from all around the world, so rebuilding anything you own from scratch is nearly impossible, as one guy found out.",
"82. You might put in orders on Amazon without much thought, but after you place an order, an incredibly intricate, hidden world of box-packing churns away to deliver your order.",
"83. Computers keep getting smarter; so fast that they often seem to be approaching (and exceeding) how smart humans are. But although they may be getting faster, they're not as clever or creative as humans are.",
"84. Electrical sockets used to be shaped like lightbulb holders, because that used to be the only thing we plugged in.",
"85, 86. You can make plastic out of mushrooms, and the process is very good for the environment. This is great, because plastic has huge, surprising consequences for the environment.",
"87. It's possible to stream wireless data from a light bulb (though it requires a line-of-sight between your device and the light).",
"Earth (and beyond)",
"88. Fish are delicious, but the way we're farming them is unsustainable, not to mention bad for Nemo. Luckily, there's a revolutionary (and fascinating) fish farming system in Spain that solves this.",
"89. Some fish and other ocean critters are positively enchanting. Want to see what I mean? Here is 5.5 minutes of footage of fascinating underwater creatures, including fish that change colors, creatures that camouflage to fit their environment, and fish that light up in the black of the ocean.",
"90. 80-90% of undersea creatures light up.",
"91. In my opinion (after watching this TED talk), one of the most interesting underwater creatures is the octopus.",
"92. Bees have been around for 50 million years, but they recently started dying en masse because of \"parasitic mites, viral and bacterial diseases, and exposure to pesticides and herbicides\".",
"93. Flowers play beautiful tricks to attract insects to spread their pollen.",
"94. How a fly flies is fascinating, and according to Michael Dickinson, \"perhaps one of the greatest feats of evolution\".",
"95. An asteroid 6 miles wide could end civilization on Earth in an instant.",
"96. The scientific odds are not against, but incredibly in favor of alien life.",
"97. One of Saturn's moons has a giant volcano that shoots out ice instead of lava. And that's just one cool part about the planet.",
"98. You can run a program on your computer that helps the University of California, Berkeley analyze radio telescope data for aliens.",
"99. Curiosity-driven science pays for itself, and drives incredible innovation for years to come.",
"100. Embrace the mystery that exists in the world. J.J. Ahrams has a mystery box that he hasn't opened in 35 years, because the potentialof what's inside the box is unlimited. which is worth way more than what's actually in the box."

			"title": "18 Life Lessons Learned From Traveling The World",
			"headline": "I never thought I would still be nomadic.",
			"contents": [
"I never thought I would still be nomadic. My original round-the-world trip was only supposed to last one year before I went back home, found a \"real\" job, settled down, and by now, be married, have a house, 2.5 children, and complain about my retirement fund to my friends.",
"Yet life took a decidedly different turn and here I am, seven years later, writing this from an overnight train to Copenhagen with the same desire to explore the world and no sign of stopping soon.",
"After so many years on the road, there are a few life lessons I've learned from travel that I never would have learned otherwise and I wanted to share with you today.",
"1. It's not that hard.",
"Every day, people get up, go out the door to travel the world, and survive and thrive. Kids as young as 18 make their way around the world without any problems. All that worrying and fear I had before my trip was for naught – this traveling thing is a lot easier than people make it out to be. You're not the first person to do it and there is a well-worn trail that makes it easy for first times to find their way. If an 18 year can do it, so can you.",
"2. You learn a lot of life skills.",
"People who travel are better adjusted and less socially anxious people and traveling around the world has taught me to how to be more social, be adept and more flexible, and, most importantly, understand non-verbal communication a lot better. It has made me more independent, more open, and, overall, just a better person. There's no reason to be scared that you might not have \"it\" in you. You'd be surprised how often you'll surprise yourself.",
"3. You are never alone.",
"It may seem scary just throwing yourself out there and talking to strangers, but we are all strangers in a strange land. At the end of the day, everyone is very friendly. It took me a while to get used to just saying \"hello\" to strangers, but now it seems like second nature. Everyone is just like you – they are alone in a strange place and are looking for others to be with. People travel to meet other people and that means you. Don't be afraid to approach other travelers and locals. You'll find that when you travel alone, you'll never really be alone.",
"4. You meet some of your closest friends traveling.",
"Whether it was in a restaurant in Vietnam, on a boat in Thailand, or walking into a hostel in Spain, when I least expected (or wanted) to meet people was when I met the best and developed the longest lasting relationships. And even though you may not see them for years, you still end up at their wedding, Christmas dinner, or family celebration. Distance and time cannot break the bond you formed.",
"5. Relationships come and go on the road.",
"I've met lots of people on the road, including members of the opposite sex I've found attractive. But the nature of travel doesn't always lend itself to long-term romantic relationships. It's hard to make something last when everyone moves in different directions and holidays end. If you get too attached too often, you'll have nothing but heartache as people come and go. But I've realized you need to simply enjoy your time together and live in the moment. Dwelling on the future will only keep you from making that leap.",
"6. But chase the ones you like.",
"Yet once in a while, you'll find someone you really connect with. Meaningful romance on the road does happen. And when you have nowhere to be and no place to go other than where you want, sometimes there is no reason not to follow. Don't force yourself to say another good-bye if you don't have to. Pursue it even if the distance seems too vast and the circumstances not right, because you never know where it could lead or how long it might last because, once in a while you meet the one and when you do, you should do everything you can to stay with them.",
"7. It's good to try new things.",
"I used to be a very rigid person, but traveling has helped me loosen up and expand my worldview. I've pushed myself to the limit, eaten new food, taken cooking classes, learned magic tricks, new languages, tried to conquer my fear of heights, and challenged my established views. Travel is all about breaking out of your comfort zone and enjoying all the world has to offer.",
"8. Be adventurous.",
"Doing the canyon swing was tough. So was jumping off the boat in the Galapagos. As was eating the maggots in Thailand and caterpillars in Africa. Then I got my butt kicked in Thai boxing. And, while I won't do most of those ever again, I don't regret trying new things. Scare yourself once in a while. It makes life less dull.",
"9. There is no such thing as a mistake.",
"No matter what happens on the road, it's never a mistake. As was once said, \"your choices are half chance, and so are everybody else's.\" When you go with the flow and let the road just unfold ahead of you, there's no reason to have regrets or think you made a mistake. You make the best decisions you can and, in the end, the journey is the adventure.",
"10. Don't be cheap.",
"When you travel on a budget and need to make your money last, it's easy to be cheap. But why live like a pauper at home while you save so you can skip the food in Italy, the wine in France, or a sushi meal in Japan? While it is good to be frugal, it's also important to splurge and not miss out on doing once-in-a-lifetime things. Who knows when you will get another chance to dive in Fiji?! Take every opportunity.",
"11. That being said, don't be wasteful.",
"But remember you aren't made of money, so don't always feel like you need to party with your new friends every night or do every activity in a new place. Sometimes it's OK just to sit around and relax or cook your own meal. Be frugal, but not cheap.",
"12. Drop the guidebook.",
"Don't be so glued to a book. You can travel fine without it, especially with so many good alternatives on the Internet these days. You'll buy it and hardly use it anyway. Just ask people for tips and information. That will be your best source of information, especially for those off-the-beaten track destinations and hole-in-the-wall restaurants that no one's ever heard of but serve the best food you can imagine.",
"13. It's never too late to change.",
"Even if you aren't the traveler or person you want to be in your head, it's never too late to change. Travel is all about change. The more you say \"tomorrow,\" the less likely it is that tomorrow will ever come. Traveling has shown me aspects of my personality I wish I didn't have and also shown me I'm really lazy. I've always lived by the phrase \"Carpe Diem\" but sometimes I don't really do it. It's never too late though and realizing that has made being more pro-active a lot easier.",
"14. Relax.",
"Life is amazing. There's no reason to worry. The universe unfolds as it should. Relax and just go with it. You can't change the future – it hasn't happened yet. Just make the best decisions you can today and enjoy the moment. Don't get caught up trying to see all the \"must sees.\" There's nothing wrong with spending a day playing games, reading a book, or lounging by the pool.",
"15. Learn more languages (seriously).",
"There're some great benefits to not knowing the local language – like miming out \"chicken\" to let the lady know you want eggs for breakfast – but learning languages is very helpful when you travel, and works out great when you meet other travelers. There's also nothing like surprising people by speaking their language. Moreover, knowing basic phrases will endear you to locals who will appreciate the fact you went the extra mile. You'll find people will be much more helpful, even if you struggle to say hello.",
"16. Wear more sunscreen.",
"Seriously. Science has proven it helps, and with all that beach time you do when you travel, you could always use a little more. Being tan is great. Having skin cancer is not. SPF up.",
"17. People are good.",
"All over the world, I have encountered amazing people who have not only changed my life but have gone out of their way to help me. It's taught me that the old saying is true – you can always depend on the kindness of strangers. My friend Greg taught me long ago not to be guarded against strangers. That experience when I first started traveling changed everything and when you travel with an open heart, unexpected goodness will happen. 99.9999% of the people in the world aren't murders, rapists, or thieves. There's no reason to assume someone is one. Sometimes people are just trying to be friendly.",
"18. There's no such thing as must-see.",
"This is your trip. No one else's. Everyone's journey is their own. Do what you want, when you want, and for how long you want. Don't let anyone tell you aren't a real traveler for skipping the Louvre, avoiding some little town in Peru, or deciding to party in Thailand. This your journey. You owe no one an explanation.",
"I've learned more about the world and myself in the last seven years of travel than I had in the previous 25 years of my life. No matter what happens in the future, I know that travel has taught me life lessons I never would have learned had I stayed in my cubicle job.",
"Find a way to travel as often has you can to all the destinations you dream about.  They will change your life."

			"title": "Architecture and the Lost Art of Drawing",
			"headline": "IT has become fashionable in many architectural circles to declare the death of drawing. What has happened to our profession, and our art, to cause the supposed end of our most powerful means of conceptualizing and representing architecture?",
			"contents": [
"IT has become fashionable in many architectural circles to declare the death of drawing. What has happened to our profession, and our art, to cause the supposed end of our most powerful means of conceptualizing and representing architecture?",
"The computer, of course. With its tremendous ability to organize and present data, the computer is transforming every aspect of how architects work, from sketching their first impressions of an idea to creating complex construction documents for contractors. For centuries, the noun \"digit\" (from the Latin \"digitus\") has been defined as \"finger,\" but now its adjectival form, \"digital,\" relates to data. Are our hands becoming obsolete as creative tools? Are they being replaced by machines? And where does that leave the architectural creative process?",
"Today architects typically use computer-aided design software with names like AutoCAD and Revit, a tool for \"building information modeling.\" Buildings are no longer just designed visually and spatially; they are \"computed\" via interconnected databases.",
"I've been practicing architecture since 1964, and my office is not immune. Like most architects, we routinely use these and other software programs, especially for construction documents, but also for developing designs and making presentations. There's nothing inherently problematic about that, as long as it's not just that.",
"Architecture cannot divorce itself from drawing, no matter how impressive the technology gets. Drawings are not just end products: they are part of the thought process of architectural design. Drawings express the interaction of our minds, eyes and hands. This last statement is absolutely crucial to the difference between those who draw to conceptualize architecture and those who use the computer.",
"Of course, in some sense drawing can't be dead: there is a vast market for the original work of respected architects. I have had several one-man shows in galleries and museums in New York and elsewhere, and my drawings can be found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Cooper-Hewitt.",
"But can the value of drawings be simply that of a collector's artifact or a pretty picture? No. I have a real purpose in making each drawing, either to remember something or to study something. Each one is part of a process and not an end in itself. I'm personally fascinated not just by what architects choose to draw but also by what they choose not to draw.",
"For decades I have argued that architectural drawing can be divided into three types, which I call the \"referential sketch,\" the \"preparatory study\" and the \"definitive drawing.\" The definitive drawing, the final and most developed of the three, is almost universally produced on the computer nowadays, and that is appropriate. But what about the other two? What is their value in the creative process? What can they teach us?",
"The referential sketch serves as a visual diary, a record of an architect's discovery. It can be as simple as a shorthand notation of a design concept or can describe details of a larger composition. It might not even be a drawing that relates to a building or any time in history. It's not likely to represent \"reality,\" but rather to capture an idea.",
"These sketches are thus inherently fragmentary and selective. When I draw something, I remember it. The drawing is a reminder of the idea that caused me to record it in the first place. That visceral connection, that thought process, cannot be replicated by a computer.",
"The second type of drawing, the preparatory study, is typically part of a progression of drawings that elaborate a design. Like the referential sketch, it may not reflect a linear process. (I find computer-aided design much more linear.) I personally like to draw on translucent yellow tracing paper, which allows me to layer one drawing on top of another, building on what I've drawn before and, again, creating a personal, emotional connection with the work.",
"With both of these types of drawings, there is a certain joy in their creation, which comes from the interaction between the mind and the hand. Our physical and mental interactions with drawings are formative acts. In a handmade drawing, whether on an electronic tablet or on paper, there are intonations, traces of intentions and speculation. This is not unlike the way a musician might intone a note or how a riff in jazz would be understood subliminally and put a smile on your face.",
"I find this quite different from today's \"parametric design,\" which allows the computer to generate form from a set of instructions, sometimes resulting in so-called blob architecture. The designs are complex and interesting in their own way, but they lack the emotional content of a design derived from hand.",
"Years ago I was sitting in a rather boring faculty meeting at Princeton. To pass the time, I pulled out my pad to start drawing a plan, probably of some building I was designing. An equally bored colleague was watching me, amused. I came to a point of indecision and passed the pad to him. He added a few lines and passed it back.",
"The game was on. Back and forth we went, drawing five lines each, then four and so on.",
"While we didn't speak, we were engaged in a dialogue over this plan and we understood each other perfectly. I suppose that you could have a debate like that with words, but it would have been entirely different. Our game was not about winners or losers, but about a shared language. We had a genuine love for making this drawing. There was an insistence, by the act of drawing, that the composition would stay open, that the speculation would stay \"wet\" in the sense of a painting. Our plan was without scale and we could as easily have been drawing a domestic building as a portion of a city. It was the act of drawing that allowed us to speculate.",
"As I work with my computer-savvy students and staff today, I notice that something is lost when they draw only on the computer. It is analogous to hearing the words of a novel read aloud, when reading them on paper allows us to daydream a little, to make associations beyond the literal sentences on the page. Similarly, drawing by hand stimulates the imagination and allows us to speculate about ideas, a good sign that we're truly alive.",
"Michael Graves is an architect and an emeritus professor at Princeton."

"So finals week is coming up, and everyone is looking for ways to be more productive in this time crunch. So I thought I could help people figure out how to make their lives more efficient and productive. People have seen my productivity hacks and they have told me I'm crazy, OCD, a workaholic, super asian, etc. I just take them as a compliment and I become flattered because I never thought myself as quite that.",
"You see, I used to be a aimless and lazy chump. I got by day-by-day using my high school planner, writing due dates and just doing things the night before. I'm not quite sure how I spent my time or where it had gone, but it's gone. I got by the bare-minimums. \"Just do enough\" was probably my life model.",
"I'm not quite sure what prompted me to change but I can tell you, it didn't happen all at in an instance. I couldn't trace the genesis of my change to any major family trauma or inspirational mentor. It started out with small things. I started out with using post it notes to write to-do lists every day. Then I thought it was pretty cool. So then I added a calendar for appointments and special events. Then I started trying out more and more productivity hacks and reading more about productivity and now I've built up a whole repertoire of tools and skills to help me stay motivated, productive, and sane.",
"My friends want to know how I do what I do. They ask me how much time I spend doing these productive things. I spend about 3 to 5 hours a week planning and preparing, but it has lead me to much higher returns. They want to know what keeps me motivated, what keeps me sane. They want to see how I tick, and I'd be happy to share.",
"The Productivity Hacking Guide is broken down into three major components or objectives: staying motivated, being efficient, and staying sane, all of which are equally important to the end goals of being productive. This guide isn't meant for just dead week and finals week, this guide could be applicable all across life. Keep up these good habits, and you'll be off to your own great things as well. You don't have to follow this guide all the way through. Take it step by step if you find it too much. Feel free to ignore some portions if you believe you have those under control (although there's always room for improvements). Feedback is also greatly appreciate so send me a line or drop a tip! :)",
"Objectives",
"Motivation: Motivation is important. How will you do great things if you can't motivate yourself to do those things? Goals will help keep you motivated. Study after study shows that people who regularly set goals do significantly better than people who don't. And other studies show that the biggest factor in determining a person's success is by their determination.",
"Efficiency: You only 168 hours a week, and you're life's already a quarter way over. How are you going to spend that time? How can you maximize your time and leverage these 168 hours so that you live the best life you possibly can? Planning out your time and recording what you have done will help you structure your time and help you identify areas where you can improve on.",
"Sanity: You don't want to burn out, that's the last thing you want to do before finals week. But if you're spending your waking hours studying your Chemistry book or doing Linear Algebra problem sets, then you might be burning out your sanity candle way earlier than you intended. How do you stay sane after being so god damn efficient?",
"Great! Let's start!",
"Goals",
"Always have big goals. Take a piece of paper out, write down anywhere from 5-10 overreaching goals in your life. If you need inspiration, you can check out mine. Goals are important because they are the lifeline of your motivation. If you want to keep yourself motivated by the end of the week, you should have these goals and write them down. They will motivate you. It could be anything, but it has to be genuine and part of you. It could be \"Open a Children's Hospital\" or \"Cure AIDS.\" Point is that is they have to be your goals, not your parents' or your friends' or your girlfriend's (although making them happy could be a goal of yours).",
"Now that you have a bunch of goals written down, open up an excel document and write down all your goals in the columns of the spreadsheet. Oh by the way make sure to save it as \"Powerful Moments.xls\" because that's what you're going to write down in the following columns. You're going to further explore your goals. This part is inspired by a blog entry by MIT admissions officer Ben Jones entitled \"50 Things.\" The whole article's a good read if you ever have time (it's just a list of 50 things that make a meaningful college experience). The purpose of the document is to substantiate your goals with real experiences, kind of like having quoting evidence when you write an essay. That way, every day when you write your goals, you'll have something empowering to think about. For instance, maybe if one of your goals was \"get good grades,\" you can write down \"06/09/12- I got an F on my math final and I realized that if I had worked harder, I would've easily gotten an A.\" It could be emotions of any form, positive, negative, sad, it just has to drive you in some shape or form.",
"Start seeding those experiences. If you find a hard time listing moments for some of these goals, you could just list why you want this as a goal. If that's troubling you, maybe it's time to pick a new one. Maybe getting good grades isn't your top priority, but becoming a doctor is, and getting good grades will help get you there. As you start digging up your chestboxes of memories, feel free to add, delete, or edit any of these goals. The point is to be reflective of who you truly are anyways.",
"If you ever encounter a powerful moment, whether when you fail a test or when someone breaks up with you, write the moment down in this excel sheet. You see, people are emotionally powered machines, and you need keep moments like these that fundamentally change who you are for the better. You're always learning a lesson from your failures. Don't let those failures slip your foresight, or you're bound to repeat them again.",
"Once you have this down, you're all set up! Top goals are done, but those seem so far away! Isn't it a bit saddening knowing the long journey you have to travel to  get to where you want to be? Well that's why we won't write just 1 Post-It note a day, we'll write 2! So it's a new morning day and you just woken up, wtf do you do with your day? Well, that's just what your second Post-It note is for. Looking at your top goals post-it, write down things you have to do for the day. It's your very own to-do list. You have to write one every day to stay focused. It takes 10 minutes a day to plan out what you want to accomplish.",
"Write down all the things you have to do for the day followed by an estimation of how much time it takes. For instance \"Study Math 1A — 1Hr\" or \"Plan Telebears Phase – 2hr.\" Try to put a small upper bound on the time commitment to these tasks so you know that you will be able to complete these tasks before the allotted time. After you listed out all the tasks you have to do, calculate the total commitment of work you have for the day. Stick this Post-it (and your top goals Post it) somewhere visible like your laptop or planner.",
"If you would like more structure, then you are welcomed to write weekly or monthly goals. Sometimes they help you structure your life road map better. I used to do it for fun. I would have \"themed weeks\" where I spent around 10-15 hours a week focusing on a different theme like \"Cooking\" or \"Breakdancing.\" Sometimes it helps to do them because habits can form during those times and in all honesty it really makes life a lot more interesting when you plan variety into it. But they work professionally as well. Right now I write a weekly post it that outlines the amount of work I have to do for the week. If you're expecting Math homework to be due every week, then you should write something like \"Math Hw — 5Hr.\" That way, when I run  a bit dry on things to do for my day, I can look up the overarching weekly goals and put in time in those goals.",
"When you write weekly or monthly goals, you should write SMART goals. SMART goals stand for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely, goals. Follow these guidelines to staying on track when you write daily, weekly, and monthly goals.",
"I would like to spend a paragraph addressing goals and the motivation behind it. Did you know the biggest factor in determining whether a person will be successful is by how determined or hardworking they are? It's true. Yet, most people wait for determination to come to them. As if waiting for some motivational cupid to shoot an arrow that sparks a passion so fiery that they work to their heart's last heartbeat. It's not coming, you have to initiate it. Determination, motivation, and inevitably self control are muscles in your body. You have to work on it, and the more you work on it, the stronger it gets. You break it down so it builds back up. It's certainly been true for me. I always thought myself as lazy, but when I decided to start creating habits of motivation, things began to change for me. I stuck through the demotivational parts where I tried my best to exercise self control and persistence, and I think I can begin seeing its effects on me. Trust me, the more you do this motivational stuff, the more motivated you will be, don't give up! That's what the top goals and powerful moments are for, it's a quick pick-me-up if you're ever feeling down.",
"Yay! Now we're done with goals!",
"Planning Your Day (And Life!)",
"If you don't use Google Calendar, start using it now (Or some form of online calendaring)! If you don't know how you spend your time, then you won't know where you're wasting time and where you can gain a couple of extra hours. So here's what you're going to do: make a schedule! Since it's already finals week and we're beginning a new semester soon, I'll just let you guys plan your schedules week by week, but usually for normal weeks I have a recurring event that is basically the skeleton to my week. Here's basically what mine looks like (but with gaps where classes were supposed to be):",
"I shall preemptively guess your thoughts:",
"Wow! It's so filled up!",
"Wow! It's so colorful!",
"James! You're crazy!",
"Yes. Let's talk a little more about this. You're going to make several calendars. I personally have 11 calendars, but you should at the very least have:",
"Normal One (Usually your name) (Green): You keep your productive miscellaneous tasks here. Calendar time is here",
"Sleep (Light Blue)",
"Food, Shower, and Transportation (Bare necessities)(Pink): Hygiene, walking (not a legal form of exercise), getting ready in the morning",
"Break or Screw Around (Yellow): Minimize these or keep them to around 5-10 hours a week.",
"Exercise (Aquamarine?)",
"School (Red) — Anything school related, including homework and studying (or you could make separate calendars)",
"Social (Orange)–Anything that involves developing relationships with other people. Social is actually an important calendar that is not meant to be minimized. I try to keep it around 5-10 hours a week. It keeps you mentally and spiritually healthy. Screwing around with your existing friends don't count because there's usually not much to talk about. This is where \"convenience\" friends come into play. If you're only around certain friends because they're convenient and accessible to you, but you don't particularly enjoy your time with, they are convenience friends. I don't count them in social, I put them in Break.",
"I would have more calendars to keep track of how much time I'm spending on each particular goal. For reference, my other calendars are:",
"Blogging (Gray)",
"Programming (Purple)",
"Startup (Blue)",
"Outside Education (Brown): I'm learning to play guitar and sing here. Audiobooks and outside reading goes here as well",
"Office Hours (Neon Purple; not shown): I keep track of my Teaching Assistant's Office Hours when I need to visit them",
"First things first when it comes to planning your week is NOT to fill it up with all your school work and things to do. You HAVE TO start with sleep, basic necessities, and break (yes, break). Why? If you have read The Now Habit (which I believe everyone should read), then you know that in order to be human, you should plan around your sleep schedule and playtime, because you need to have those or you'll lose steam really quickly. Work hard, play hard. Get an ideal but doable weekly schedule going, with spaces in between to stay flexible.",
"Remember the previous exercise we did on writing daily goals and tasks? It's time to plan those into your calendar. The rule of thumb is that if your task is longer than 30 minutes, you plan it on your schedule, if your task is longer than 15 minutes, you group them together (I like to use the tasks feature in Google Calendar) and set a time for the day to do all your < 15-min tasks. If it's a 5 minute task or less, you do it on the spot. Trust me, you'll feel so much better. You plan your day everyday, the skeleton is just to help structure your day, give it a template.",
"Google calendars has some other neat features as well. You can have your calendar send you reminders as well. Whether it's iPhone reminders, email reminders, or text reminders, you can give get it. You don't have to keep track of everything in your head anymore. That just wastes your brain bandwidth that you could be using for other things. You can also add and organize your tasks on your Google calendar. I sometimes put it there if I can't immediately act on the task, like getting back to someone you promised you would.",
"It order to maximize your productivity, you want to aim for as well distributed color of a calendar as possible. Having a giant chunk of school isn't going to do your productivity or memory any good. Mix in some exercise in the middle, or some time to hang out with your friends. Aim for a time interval on a particular task that slightly pushes you to exercise your willpower, but definitely keep it in a doing time frame. If you find that you can concentrate on a particular task for 30 minutes, try going for 45 minutes next time, or even a hour, before switching tasks. Building concentration, like will power, is a form of exercise that only grows stronger through practice.",
"Why it works",
"Have you ever watched an installation bar when you were a kid? Doesn't the loading bar move slow excruciatingly slowly. And then you begin to play games like pointing to the bar, counting to 10, and seeing how far you've gone? You distract yourself from knowing how far along you are and focus on the moving blue bar rather the 33% sign on the side. Having a calendar system is like that. The calendar works and helps beat procrastination and  stagnation because it reduces brain bandwidth and allows us to focus on the present. Many people's lives are ruled by their pasts or their futures. They live lives full of regret or worry, and are often paralyzed by these fears. If you were to plan ahead in your head, then you would have to consider future worries that are inactionable, and you would have to think about these all the time. That paper deadline will always be in your head because you can't let it out, and if you do let it out, you will forget. We are also frozen by our past regrets, which may render us helpless. By allocating time to plan out your day or week ahead, you can spend 30 mins a day looking ahead so you wouldn't have to worry about what you have to do throughout your day or where you're going with your life, you can stay in the now and focus on the task at hand without cluttering. If you plan well, then the path to completion shouldn't be about staring at the status bar the whole time.",
"Keeping Track of Your Time",
"Do you ever wonder where your time went? In a blink of an eye you're already 18, 19, or 20. What exactly have you done with (about) a quarter of your life? Well, as Monte Cristo once said, \"You can kill me, but at least let me keep my memories.\" (or something like that, that was the essence). Point is that without consciously living out our lives on a daily basis, doing meaningful things, life can seem to flash by. Whether it's because you're playing or working too hard, time seems to slip, so you want to know where it has gone.",
"Methods",
"There are various ways to log your time, and I usually stick to 2 or 3 ways that is pretty effective to keep track of what you do. The first is using Google Calendar. Usually throughout the day, when you have a couple of minutes or so throughout the day, spent a couple of seconds to recall what you have done during the day. I usually keep things in 30 minute intervals, because that's the lowest denominator of time spent on Google Calendar. So in the previous photo of the calendar, I could write down things like \"homework\" or \"sleep\" or \"hang out with friends.\"",
"Naturally, you will probably run into the problem of forgetting what you did or losing track of time. That is not good. You will have to recover it and try to remember. Usually not remembering what you were doing is a bad sign, because you weren't living consciously or were aware of what you were doing. BAAAAAAD, don't let it happen. But we can usually recover or jog your memory as to what happened.",
"One of the easiest way to find out what you were doing is probably your browser history. That's usually where people end up slipping. Maybe they caught a photo of a leaping cat on their newsfeed, which led them to reddit, and they all of a sudden spent 2 hrs browsing through internet sites. Yeah, checking your browser history will give you a definitive log of what you did. Another source of clues is your text messages. Maybe you actually spent the last 30 minutes texting a girl (who has subsequently friend-zoned you).",
"Other times you can jog some memories as to the context of the situation. Those are usually the two ways I tend to remember what has happened if I forget. But if these sources fail, fear not! Just leave it blank. Most people aren't as OCD as I am when it comes to these things.",
"Another way to keep track of time is do download RescueTime (ref link). Yes, get it. What RescueTime does is keep track of your computer time and logs your hours. It could be very enlightening as to how you spend your time on the computer, and there are so many features on RescueTime that make life so much more productive. It's completely customizable and it'll help you realize the depressing amount of time you spend on Facebook.",
"Logging Your Time",
"Start a new excel sheet (I usually like to keep separate excel sheets for each term like 1st semester freshman year, summer, etc), and in the rows start listing out the times you want to track. Usually it entails goals and all your calendar activities. Here's what mine looks like. It could act like a template for you:At the beginning of every week, you go back to your last week's calendar and count up how much time you spent for each of these rows. There are certain rules I follow to ensure that I keep an accurate recount of everything. You can choose to follow these rules or not, or make up your own.",
"Rules",
"Food, Shower, or Transportation plus anything else that's productive would eliminate the FoShoTrans time slot. For instance, if I spent my 30 mins in the shower singing, then I won't count the shower time, but will count the singing time instead. This helps alleviate the amount of time one spends eating, showering, and commuting. Sleeping on the bus would eliminate the transportation time.",
"Productive tasks are rounded down and unproductive tasks are rounded up. 15mins spent on productive tasks means 0 hrs on your calendar, whereas in an unproductive calendar it entails 30 mins.",
"Social calendar is very ambiguous, if you eat with the same people during lunch over and over again, that is not considered a social activity, you're too comfortable around those people and not developing meaningful relationships with them. Eating lunch with new people, going out of your comfort zone to talk to strangers, or hitting on girls count as social. The reasoning is behind my goals #4, #5 (Be social and meet girls). It doesn't count if you're just sitting with the same people, it's quite unproductive actually unless you're developing a more meaningful relationship (like helping a friend with a crisis or talking about your problems)..",
"Anything productive that doesn't fall into any of the categories is your name calendar (i.e. default calendar). This could mean emails, calendar analysis, extra curricular meetings, and preparing for your day.",
"Prep and Prep day are separate. Prep is dressing up, brushing your teeth, washing your face, and getting ready for school. Prep day entails goal writing, day planning, 5-minute tasks, and post-it writing.",
"Unaccounted is any blank spaces you leave on your calendar. Time left is total time in the week subtracted by the total amount of time you log. It could be negative if you multitask or count things twice.",
"Read/OLearn is reading and outside learning. RT-Prod is RescueTime Productive time (you can find this number in your RescueTime account) RT-Dis is RescueTime Distracting. It's the unproductive time of RescueTime. The Top 3 Dis. is the top 3 distractions, just so I can identify the most distracting things I'm doing.",
"I usually write a quick summary as well. At the end of the spreadsheet I like to add a couple of more columns like Total, Average, and Standard Deviation . If you know some basic excel skills, this should be no problem. The standard deviation is actually an important indicator because it tells you how consistent you are at staying on target with your goals.",
"I have a comment section to note things that occur. Usually it's commenting about how I spend my time and how I feel about the future. Definitely look over the statistics to identify places where you can save time. Maybe you spend too much time preparing for your day (I average around 10% of my time on FoShoTrans), or maybe you sleep too much, or hang out with your friends too often. Whatever it is, you have to consider whether it is contributing to your goals or whether it is necessary for your survival. If it's neither of these, it's time to cut them down. Now you have mastered your time. Moving on to how to save time.",
"Time Saving Tricks",
"Online Activities",
"You should start checking out your RescueTime stats after a week now. It probably has some demoralizing statistics for you (or optimistic, who knows). Point is, you know you can do better. How? StayFocusd (Chrome Extension) and Self Control (Mac Apps).",
"StayFocusd gives you a set amount of time for distracting internet time every day. You list all the common distracting websites you browse, and give yourself a limit to how much time you want to spend on the website everyday. Then have it run in the browser. Afterwards, everytime you surf a \"blocked website,\" the countdown clock will slowly wind down. Once you reached 0:00, you are done with distracting sites for the day, and StayFocusd blocks those sites. It'll seriously make you so much more efficient with your Facebook time, you'll be blazing through your notifications to avoid dwelling on someone else's life. No more getting distracted by hot girls from your old high school who posts vacation photos. It forces you to put a priority on the information you're interested — ones involving you or ones involving other people's lives",
"Another setting you should add is the nuclear option. Set your nuclear option to automatically block all your distracting sites from 2AM-8AM (or earlier/later if you prefer). Because nothing happens on Facebook at 2AM, so constantly refreshing and checking your notifications isn't going to do squat for your enjoyment nor your productivity. Also, there is a strong correlation that the sleepier we get, the more easily distracted we get. So if you don't have your work finished, you shouldn't be browsing, and if you do, you should be sleeping.",
"And you should just block certain sites and applications. Give up video games and television. Do they really benefit your life? I found it depressing when I couldn't recite all 150 original pokemons today when I used to live and breathe that television show when I was a kid, spending hours upon hours wasting my childhood engaging in that show. The same goes with video games like Runescape, Neopets, and Maple Story. Sure it relieves stress, but there are so many other ways that could release stress more AND make you a better person AND use less time. Check out the \"How to Keep Your Sanity\" section.",
"Self Control is a similar app that blocks distracting sites, but it acts more like a timer. When you decide to turn on Self Control for a certain amount of time, you physically shut off the distracting sites from the internet for a certain amount of time. You just can't go on them, Self Control just blocked the IP addresses from your computer for a certain amount of time. Now you know there is no stopping it, and you could go back to doing your work. I find this helpful if I can't help but browse Facebook and I'm just wasting my time. Just turn this on and get back to work.",
"Sleep",
"Sleep is my biggest weakness, but it also the most important part of your life. Getting out of bed is the hardest thing to do and being sleepy is one of the most demotivating things you can experience. Because what is better than glorious, glorious sleep? I sleep around 7 hours a day, but I tend to vary a lot in my sleep time. Maybe you can do better with 6 or 5 hours of sleep. I'll tell you what I know and hopefully you can get by with less sleep. This section tends to be very opinionated and on a personal basis. It could work for you, but if it doesn't, forget it. Honestly, sleep should be the last thing you cut out of your schedule, this is almost as a last resort. Having adequate sleep is very important. I almost don't recommend you cutting back on sleep. But if you need that extra boost or would like higher quality sleep, read on!",
"The key to sleeping? Naps. Naps are scientifically proven to leverage more sleep than large chunks of sleep. I think it's true as well. I always take a nap in the afternoon dip in the engineering library. It does wonders for your focus. You're going to want to do homework or study right before you take those naps (then you become really sleepy) and right after, when you become much more focused. Taking more than one nap is encouraged as well. In fact, you should check out this sleep hacking chart. I've never fully transitioned to these schedules, but I know the key is to stay consistent . If you have the self-control (or are coincidentally busy enough), then it will probably work out for you.",
"If I'm on a time crunch, I try not to sleep on my bed. Beds are too comfortable, and you might sleep more than you have to. Couches and desks, on the other hand, are only comfortable enough to sleep until you can survive. I have leveraged much more time and focus from sleeping on couches and desks that it helps me stay awake for longer times in the night. If you plan on sleeping until the morning, but you're only getting like 3-4 hours of sleep, consider sleeping with the lights on. Something about it makes my rest more restful.",
"I'm going to spend a paragraph talking about one of my worst nightmares–food comas. Food comas for me tend to not contribute very well to your sleep time while making you very, very tired. You wake up miserable but not well rested. I always end up getting a food coma from eating food from the dining halls and feel pretty bad afterwards. I think there are some ways to prevent food comas. First off, limit the carbs you eat, especially simple carbs from the dining hall. Carbs make you sleepy. Avoid it by eating more proteins or a salad. You could also not eat as much (you know you don't need another plate of curly fries). Another thing you have to do is to stay hydrated. Always drink water. It's actually a good ideas for any situation to help you stay awake. Your brain needs water to function and sometimes you need water to stay awake. Do you ever get the feeling when you sleep for a long time and you wake up with a headache or feel lightheaded? That's because you're dehydrated, either because you didn't drink enough water or you sleep so long that by now most of your water has left your body. A similar concept goes into eating food. If you don't drink water, the food's going to suck up all the water and you're going to be dehydrated, and therefore sleepy. If you do plan on napping, try to drink as much water as you can before your nap, and the first sign of consciousness you have, even if you're super sleepy, get a sip of water. That's actually how I get out of bed every day. First thing I do when I reach consciousness is drink water, because our body needs it most when we're awake.",
"If you have trouble waking up despite the amount of hours you sleep, it's probably a problem with your self-control. Set up an alarm, and make sure you don't compromise with yourself and sleep another 10 mins. It will only make you feel more tired when you wake up and scientifically it doesn't help you feel more well rested. Just do it. Perhaps plan something you can look forward to. If alarms sound too intrusive, consider getting a vibrating alarm. These alarms not only have the option to blast off your ears, they also have an option to have a vibrating unit placed under your unit to buzz you awake. It's actually pretty relaxing way to wake up, it's calming and gets my blood flowing. It doesn't even wake my roommates up because it's so quiet and only I could feel it. In fact, my roommates have gotten so envious of my alarm system that both of them bought the EXACT same alarm clock model as me. Now we have 3 of the exact same alarm clock in my room =.=",
"Sleep in chunks of 90 minutes. That's usually how long a complete sleep cycle lasts. Of course this varies from person to person, so adjust accordingly. If you want to have a \"gentle\" way of waking up, you should try the Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock for iPhone (Sleep as Android for Android users). It has great reviews and it has worked pretty well for me. It uses your phone's accelerometer to determine how much you move during your sleep and uses that metric to determine what stage you are in your sleep schedule and wakes you up accordingly based on your sleep stage. The only problem with it was that since it requires that you put your phone next to your pillow (i.e. very close to you), I have a tendency to turn it off quickly. But overall, it does pretty good wonders.",
"Other methods of waking up that I've tried that have worked in the past are moaning and/or groaning as loudly as you can, doing the Bruce Almighty wake up routine, shifting to a doggy style position, leaning my head over the bed (so blood flows to my brain), or getting someone to wake you up (Hi Mom!). Good luck with your sleep. Sleep is necessary! Don't pull all nighters. Stay consistent (even on weekends), and follow these tips.",
"Food, Shower, Transportation",
"If you have started logging your hours right now, you will realize that you spend an absurd amount of time just eating, preparing for your day, showering, hygiene, and transportation. I spend around 11% of my total time doing this stuff, totaling 264.5 hours in my 14 weeks here at Berkeley. There has got to be a better use of these times.",
"So I've broken it down to things you can do WHILE  you do these. It'll help you cut down time as I don't count FoShoTrans when I multitask.",
"Food",
"Study homework or class material. Rarely do you have both hands free to do homework while you eat and I strongly discourage doing so. Doing homework while eating will only extend the amount of time it takes for you to eat. Studying counts as school work.",
"Meet new people. Sit with someone new and talk to them. Count that in the social calendar",
"Sit with someone you know but haven't sit in a while. That's Social.",
"Listen to Audiobooks. That's Outside Education.",
"Check your emails. Only do this if you are comfortable responding to emails on your phone. I have forgotten to respond to many emails because I was too lazy to type things on my phone, and forget them the next time I check my inbox. This belongs is misc. productivity.",
"Shower",
"Singing. It's good practice and makes your voice sound amazing no matter how shitty it usually sounds. One of the best days in my life was when I discovered that my university academic service centers had a laminator that we could use for free. I now print out song lyrics I can take to my shower. And because of the water cohesion, the laminated lyrics stick onto the wall like a screen protector on a phone. Outside Learning",
"Minor dancing or bouncing. Nothing involving footwork. Outside learning.",
"If you're hardcore, try stretching or doing squats while you shower. Exercise.",
"Hygiene/Prep",
"Audiobooks. That's all you really could do. Don't try anything else. There are too many tasks in hygiene that introducing another activity would only slow the amount of time to do all your hygienic and preparatory work.",
"Transportation",
"Audiobooks.",
"Singing",
"Talk to people (if you can)",
"Sleeping (if on a bus)",
"Read a book (if you're on a bus or can see where you're going)",
"Note about audiobooks: Audiobooks could mean any form of auditory learning, whether it's audiobooks, Podcasts, itunesU, TedTalks, or other forms of learning. I could go through them pretty quickly as I commute around every day. I tend to read less-than-legally downloaded books because there's a wider selection of subjects. But if you like something, you should definitely consider buying it. There are plenty of legal sites that offer a wide selection of audiobooks. If you don't have audiobooks, download tedtalks or get a TED app from the app store. Or if have the radio, find your NPR station. I like reading fiction books via audiobooks and sparknoting the summary plots afterwards to make sure I'm on the right path. There is also a strong collection of self-help books for your benefit as well. But audiobooks are your friend. Everyone's listening to music all day, every day, you should spend some of that music time into audiobook time. You spend most of your working time listening to music anyways. I spend about 2 hours a day commuting back and forth from my dorm to school and around campus to classes. If I spent all that time listening to audiobooks (which I won't), I'll could read Ender's Game 65 times. A lot of times I listen at 2x speed as well if I feel particularly focused or if the book tends to have a lot of fluffy material. Imagine all the knowledge you could gain if you just spent your typical 1 hour a day listening to something informational on your iPod or MP3 Player.",
"Personally I like real books and TedTalks, but people could have their own opinions. But do it! It will change your intellectual life.",
"Simplification of Your Life",
"After my quest to find out how to squeeze the most things out of my time, I found out that there are things that have juice that aren't worth the squeeze. It's not that I'm lazy. My friend once quoted Pareto's Law from Tim Ferris' book \"The Four-Hour Workweek,\" \"80% of the work you get done is done by 20% of your time.\" 20% of your input generates 80% of your output. \"Well,\" I questioned, \"does that mean I could do 400% more work?\"",
"Although I won't take it to that extreme, there are factors that may to taking more time than you originally intend to. Perhaps you're spending more time reading email than you would like, or you're investing in unrewarding relationships,  you'll probably reconsider whether those activities and commitments are worth your time or effort or not. Your time is valuable, so take some time every week or month to see if the things you're doing are time well spent.",
"Study Tips",
"Develop Good Work Ethics",
"Everyone has a different style of studying. Some people like to study in their rooms, others like to study in a noisy coffee shop. Some like to get a study group together, others like to study alone. Whatever your preferences are, there are still some core fundamentals to studying productively. I'll try to elucidate some tips to helping you become the most productive student in Berkeley.",
"The most important thing to remember is that in general if you aren't inspired to do homework, the best thing is just start working anyways. Seriously, this has helped me so tremendously. Never think about an assignment as a task of completion, but rather a task of initiation. This is again re-emphasized in The Now Habit . You should never ask yourself, \"when should I finish this assignment?\" But rather you should always ask yourself \"when can I begin?\" Notice the use of \"can.\" It uses a sense of optimism and sense of commitment. If you don't want to start an assignment, commit yourself to doing it for only 15 minutes. 15 minutes (usually less) is the amount of time is takes to get your brain in the mood of studying or doing homework. Treat every task as a start of a journey, even if you're finishing up a project. The starting mentality gets better with practice, but the concept holds.",
"Never play the victim when it comes to difficult tasks, always take the proactive role. You're only going to make yourself miserable if you go against your free will and saying \"I have to do it.\" Instead, changing your mentality to \"I want to do it\" could completely change how you see your assignments and assignments. Why, after all, are you taking a class if it's not to learn about a particular subject or major? What you're doing should be directly relevant to you and your goals",
"This brings me to another point. You have to convince yourself that you are a hard worker. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. There was a scientific study (back by other institutions) that basically goes like this (further explained by the NYMag Article):",
"A group of children are divided into two experimental groups. Both groups of students are given a moderately difficult but doable task of completing mental challenges. One group of students were then praised for \"being smart\" while the other group was praised for \"being hardworking.\" The researchers then gave the children a choice of another mental task: a task that is the same difficulty as the one they completed or a task that is harder to solve. Researchers found out that the 90% of the children who were praised for their work ethics chose the harder task whereas a majority (probably around 55%) of the children who were praised for their intelligence chose the easier task.",
"Maybe you're blaming your parents for fucking  you up as a child by praising your intelligence and making you lazy (I had a mixture of praise of both). But for fucks sake you're in college now. Your position in life right now is your own doing, take some control over your life and your attitude on life.",
"The problem with modern society is, no one's going to praise you for your hard work. Everyone's going to talk about how smart you are, or how you can ace tests without studying, or can do things without trying. Don't get sucked into this. Sometimes I find praises like these offensive or condescending. I've worked hard for my grades and knowledge, I want to be rewarded for what I've earned, not ascribed as a trait that is supposedly inherent in me. People have complimented me on these attributes. \"James why are you so smart?\" \"James you're such a fast learner!\" \"James you're just godly with CS.\" Yeah, no shit, it's because I spend more time dedicating myself to these activities that I have reached this level. Sometimes I feel like people do that to mess with me, to put me on a pedestal just so they can watch me stumble and fall. The pressure of holding up an image of being naturally smart is hard and frankly completely stupid. Peers who peer pressure you into this image should not be around you at all. Correct them if they are ignorant, but cut them loose if they want to see you fail.",
"Point is you have to praise yourself for your hard work whenever you accomplish something. No one else will do it for you. If someone asks you why you are so smart, you reply that it's because you worked really hard in this class. You want to be perceived as an honest and hard worker. Every time you check a bullet off your to-do list. Congratulate yourself on how hard you've worked to get the pleasure of scratching the task off your Post-It note. Even say self-praises out loud if you can. I've actually taken a fully Anthony Robbins  self improvement course where I had to take walks every day at 8AM for a whole week where the audiotape tells you to chant \"Everyday in every way I'm getting better and better\" or \"I know I can because I can\" or turning an \"energy dial\" at the center of your chest. It's cheesy but it works in mysterious ways.",
"Everything you have that is important to you, you have earned it at one point or another. Whether it's your grades, your girlfriend, your reputation, your body, your friends, it's all done through hard work. Spend some time to understand and embrace that concept. When people hand you things on a silver platter, it's no accomplishment of yours. Work hard.",
"Study Habits",
"Now that you have a good mentality to start with, here's how you keep the flame going. Use the pomodoro technique (watch the video!). The idea is that you set aside 25 minutes of uninterrupted work. That means during these 25 mins you don't take text messages, phone calls. You don't go on Facebook. Don't even think about eating or going on other websites. Even if someone comes up to you and talk, spend a quick 10 seconds explaining that you're busy right now and you'll talk to them when you're available. Just focus. The point of this time-boxing technique is that since you are dedicating the time to do something, you might as well be as productive as you can within this time. Have you ever had those classes where teachers give 10 minutes of class time in the end of the class to start on your homework and everyone clamors to get their homework finished by then? The idea's the same. You're stuck in class for an hour anyways, with no distractions, you might as well make the best out of it.",
"Now when your 25 minutes is done, you get a 5 minute break to do whatever you want. Check your texts, calls, FB notifs. Talk to someone. I suggest stretch and minor exercise breaks. After the break is done, you go back to your work and start a new pomodoro.",
"I personally do pomodoro chunks of 55 mins followed by 5 mins, but 25 min is probably more efficient for beginners. It's difficult to do at first, but you'll get the hang of it. I personally use Time Out to track my pomodoro times because it's automatic (it goes on and off automatically) and it actually blocks your computer screen so it forces you to stand up and stretch, get water, or go to the bathroom while you wait.",
"Also, to help me focus, I open up two windows. One of them is my personal stuff (I usually open my gmail, calendar, rainymood.com, and 8tracks.com, hypem.com, or songza.com), and one of the other one is purely academics. So if I'm working on my computer science homework, I would keep all relevant CS pages open on my second window and hide my first one. The idea behind this is that you keep your personal and academic tabs separate so you don't see flashing tabs at you or tempting you like a button waiting to be pushed.",
"Also a key point is to never check your email or facebook the first thing you do. It's going to set a bad first step forward to your study session and you'll mostly likely get hooked or distracted by one thing or another.",
"How to Keep Your Sanity",
"People burn out, it's a fact. People crumble under the stress. One-too-many all-nighters pulled could change a goody-two-shoes into a hardcore, biker-shoes heroin-addict. You think this whole sanity thing is like a disease stricken upon unsuspecting over achievers, but in reality it's completely preventable.",
"How do you stay focused in all this stress and work? You need to find some ways. I'll show you some of mine.",
"Pick a Hobby (or Two or More)",
"As I iterated before, you HAVE TO plan fun times, break times to help you destress or unwind. This doesn't have to mean mind-numbing television or drugs and alcohol (I actually highly discourage it). I recommend both a sport and a creative outlet.",
"Exercise is important to keep everyone happy. Even if you aren't getting enough sleep, you should still exercise a bit. Exercising produces happy hormones that makes you happy and it's a great change of pace from your typical school work. You'll meet a more diverse group of people than your classes. You'll get the stress out. Sometimes I exercise with all my problems on my mind. I physically exert my frustrations on whatever's on hand, whether it's lifting weights or running hard for the frisbee so that by the time I'm dead tired, the problems don't seem so problemsome anymore, and I achieve a sense of tranquility that helps me tackle my other challenges when I'm done. It's really rewarding. Go to the gym, join an intramural or club team, or just throw a frisbee with your roommate. It's going to make a significant difference, and it'll help you keep off those freshman 15. Spend at least 5 hours a week exercising (Walking around campus doesn't count).",
"Pick a creative outlet. Whether it's guitar, singing, drawing, writing, photoshopping, cooking, corn-maze-designing, find something that is outside your major that you enjoy doing. It doesn't have to be something you're good at, but you should enjoy doing it. For example, I love singing, but I'm just so horrendously horrible at it. So what I do is I make sure I stay on campus until late at night until the libraries close (around 1 or 2AM), then when I walk home, there won't be anybody around me to hear me so I could sing to my heart's content. It's so relaxing when you reward yourself with these small things for your hard work.  Try picking up an instrument or a hobby. You don't have to stick with one. Check out this reddit post out for ideas and these online resources for ideas. If you're like me, you're going to want to learn everything because everything is so exciting.",
"Spend Time Alone",
"You're going to have to spend some time out of your hectic day to reflect on your life. I tend to do this on my walks home at night. Sometimes all it takes is a deep breath of solace and enjoy the peaceful environment around you as you reflect on where you are in life and the exciting adventures ahead of you. I just smile knowing what I've done that day and how satisfying it is to accomplish what I did.",
"Other times I do it in my room. I find cleaning my room very therapeutic. Singing in the shower also works wonders for your mental health and spirit. Just anything you want to do for fun, just do it. Sometimes I eat out by myself, and not give a crap about what other people think.",
"Spending time alone doesn't always mean happy times. There are moments when I'm sad or homesick as well. Sometimes you want to go back home or go back to when things once were. School's too stressful, your classes are too hard, life's too unfair. It's depressing I understand. During these moments, I like to go to someplace isolated and quiet at night (where you have a decent amount of privacy and peace), and just sit down. Just sit, don't do anything. If you have peaceful, classical or soft indie music, you can play those. I just sit and think about my life. Sometimes I cry a bit (I don't like to cry in front of others). I just think about my life, or stare into space. Don't be afraid to cry, you've found a private space for a reason. It's cathartic and really does solve some personal problems for you. Other times I just sigh a lot. Listen to lyrics if you want to, sometimes they are soothing. Frank Ocean once said, \"When you're happy, you enjoy the music. But when you're sad, you understand the lyrics.\" Sit there for as long as you want to or feel like. Eventually you'll feel slightly more peaceful even though nothing's been resolved. Then you'll look at the night sky and perhaps the stars. Maybe you'll look at the scenery if there is one, and you begin to appreciate the things you have. Be grateful for those things. It doesn't have to be something superficial like owning the iPhone 6, it should be gratitude for your health, your family, or the fact that you don't have that hated class tomorrow.",
"When you feel like you're ready, you can head back to your room to get cleaned up or fall asleep (sleep tends to be a major contributing factor to how happy I am).",
"Keep a Close Friend Around (or Have an Awesome Sister Like Ruby Maa)",
"I would like to run a social experiment. My sister Ruby Maa is stressed at MIT right now. She has worked so much harder than me studying Chemical Engineering in college. I think she would appreciate it if a bunch of strangers (or even just some) sent her an encouraging facebook message (via link) like \"Thanks for being such an awesome sister for James Maa. And good luck on your finals!\" would be awesome. It's just an optional request because I'm so grateful for my sister :')",
"But yes, keep a close friend around, someone you can tell all your secrets to and someone who is patient enough to listen to you complain about your daily life. Really take advantage of the network of friends you have, many of them (including myself) do have some form of interest in hearing about your problems. Find someone who's willing to listen and tell them about some of your concerns you have in life. Don't burden them with trivial stuff though, like \"OMG I hate my professor\" or milk them for compliments by saying \"OMG I'm so fat\" (which is supposed to prompt the response \"no you're not!\" followed by some compliment, but I have ceased to indulge anyone who does this to me).",
"Real life concerns I have discussed with my sister are things like \"I'm not sure if I should switch majors\" or \"Man sometimes I get really homesick\" or \"Sometimes I feel so dumb\" or \"I really want to give up and become a vagabond.\"",
"You don't have to talk to them looking for answers. Just saying out your problems out loud is enough to alleviate the stress you're experiencing. It also has the magical effect of making you and your friend closer. My sister was super supportive (in her own way) when I said, \"Man, sometimes I feel so lonely, I just can't seem to get close to anyone.\" and she just said, \"yeah, that's me for the past 2.5 years.\" And that made me feel 10 times better knowing someone is in the same situation and could sympathize.",
"Have a Role Model",
"Find someone who's someone you want to be. And it's better if your role model obtained his fame or achievements through hard work and not naturally born talent (think Steve Jobs not Lebron James). I have several role models who I can look up to. Some of  them are my friends who I won't divulge, but sometimes the personal element to it helps you understand your role models as human beings and not demi-gods.",
"Ruby's one of my role models because she probably works harder than me, sleeps less than me, and gets better grades than me. She's awesome at life even though it may seem a bit unbalanced. But knowing her as a sister I can tell that she wasn't born a MIT student, she earned it through her hard work, and she got into MIT through that despite all the hardships she faced (including being the 2nd generation asian family guinea pig). Most of my problems are trivial compared to the ones she faces everyday, and it just makes my life seem more exciting when I'm playing catch up with my sis (whom I want to beat someday).",
"Start a Blog",
"Start a blog. Get one on tumblr or wordpress. Or buy a domain name and get cheap hosting. Ask me if you have any problems with this.",
"Write two things every days that made you smile or made you grateful. Try to ignore the bad things, they usually don't deserve a spot there. The purpose isn't to attract an audience or to cave into consumer demands, it's to ensure that you are grateful and optimistic with your life every day. Small things, like a cute girl smiling your way, or finding $5 on the sidewalk could change your perspective on how your day was. Focus on the good things, the different things, and your life can seem like a series of adventures, day by day. You'll begin to ask yourself \"I wonder what exciting things will show up on my blog tomorrow\" and you'll begin to seek out adventures for yourself.",
"If you would like, you should have weekly, monthly, and yearly highlights. That way it forces you to read your blog posts. It'll really structure your semester and help you answer the question, \"What the fuck did I do during this time?\"",
"Go Outside Your Comfort Zone",
"Relieve your stress by going outside your comfort zone. As they say, \"kill the tension before the tension kills you.\" Go ask that cute girl on a date, go breakdance in your lounge, show up to class in your Stanford pajamas or banana suit. Probably not that crazy, but you get the idea, take risks, it's the thing that will make you feel alive when you feel dead for most of the day.",
"Try to do one thing that scares you every day, it'll make a difference as to how you see how you spent your life everyday. It could be \"I studied all day\" or \"I studied all day AND asked a girl out AND got flat out rejected\" (awesome! that'll be a great story to tell) or \"I studied all day AND asked a girl out AND scored a date\" FUCKING HI-FIVES! :D If you have trouble, think of this motto: \"Always make the decision that makes for a better story to tell.\"",
"If you want variety, try doing rejection therapy or the comfort challenge. It has done wonders for me.",
"Introduce Variety",
"Do something different. Flush the toilet with your left hand. Try drawing the lecturer's face onto a sphinx. Hopscotch your way down the sidewalk. Take a different route, try a different restaurant, study in a new place. Anything to break out your monotone habits (keep the good habits though!). Variety helps keep you sane because you still have traction of your time in memorable ways. One time I found out that Sproul Plaza (my university's biggest plaza and busiest) rents out tables for clubs to promote their organizations. I decided to fake being a club and rent out a table to do homework. It was so rewarding and exciting that my friend and I are starting a \"Homework on Sproul\" club for those students who want to combine the academic and social experience of college.",
"Just Take A Break",
"Sit around, go on reddit, hang out with your friends, watch tv, be unproductive every once in awhile. Usually in the moments of the highest stress we realize the things we always wanted to do in our free time, and usually it doesn't involve video games or tv. Spend some time to do these cool things. Go paintballing, hang out at the beach, or just watch a movie with some friends. You deserved it.",
"Don't study the waking hours of your dead week. Spend a bit of time to do other things as well. Just chill for an hour after a long session of work.",
"You'll feel so much more refreshed afterwards that you become more willing to tackle on new challenges.",
"Some Neat Instant Happiness",
"Compiled from my own life guide and from Reddit:",
"Waving at people in cars when I cross a crosswalk. They often smile and wave back",
"Listening to music when I eat food, it kind of sets the mood",
"When I wake up in the morning I like to roll around, curl up, and stretch like a cat in my bed.",
"Taking showers in the dark. It's so soothing",
"Smiling. Just smiling would make you happy.",
"Skipping instead of walking",
"A Caveat",
"During my productivity pursuit, I have fallen into the trap of putting a lot of my life on pause. If I imagine going back to high school, there were so many moments when I convinced myself that I couldn't enjoy my high school life because I was busy preparing for college, doing homework, or studying for tests. All those statements weren't true by the way. I always ended up not being particularly productive, and always more depressed. But the point is that I managed to miss out on so many fun and amazing opportunities in my life because I thought the only way to be a productive student was to cut out all joy and pleasure from it. It's what I was raised on anyways. My mom always told me to sacrifice your happiness now for the happiness of your future.",
"But I think it's a load of B.S. . You can be productive AND have fun at the same time. Work hard play hard. Because I have established that you must do X, Y, and Z to keep yourself sane, those act as your forms of life. These are the memories you will cherish when you are out of college. You'll remember your hard work, but the memory of the hard work is cumulative. The moments you remember most are the individual experiences, the one Friday night out, the one football game, the new thing you tried, the new girl you met. These are the stories you will be proud to tell your sons and grandsons, so don't let school get in the way."

			"title": "Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard",
			"headline": "The first question any thoughtful person might ask when reading the title of this essay is, \"Hard for whom?\"",
			"contents": [
"The first question any thoughtful person might ask when reading the title of this essay is, \"Hard for whom?\" A reasonable question. After all, Chinese people seem to learn it just fine. When little Chinese kids go through the \"terrible twos\", it's Chinese they use to drive their parents crazy, and in a few years the same kids are actually using those impossibly complicated Chinese characters to scribble love notes and shopping lists. So what do I mean by \"hard\"? Since I know at the outset that the whole tone of this document is going to involve a lot of whining and complaining, I may as well come right out and say exactly what I mean. I mean hard for me, a native English speaker trying to learn Chinese as an adult, going through the whole process with the textbooks, the tapes, the conversation partners, etc., the whole torturous rigmarole. I mean hard for me -- and, of course, for the many other Westerners who have spent years of their lives bashing their heads against the Great Wall of Chinese.",
"If this were as far as I went, my statement would be a pretty empty one. Of course Chinese is hard for me. After all, any foreign language is hard for a non-native, right? Well, sort of. Not all foreign languages are equally difficult for any learner. It depends on which language you're coming from. A French person can usually learn Italian faster than an American, and an average American could probably master German a lot faster than an average Japanese, and so on. So part of what I'm contending is that Chinese is hard compared to ... well, compared to almost any other language you might care to tackle. What I mean is that Chinese is not only hard for us (English speakers), but it's also hard in absolute terms. Which means that Chinese is also hard for them, for Chinese people.1",
"If you don't believe this, just ask a Chinese person. Most Chinese people will cheerfully acknowledge that their language is hard, maybe the hardest on earth. (Many are even proud of this, in the same way some New Yorkers are actually proud of living in the most unlivable city in America.) Maybe all Chinese people deserve a medal just for being born Chinese. At any rate, they generally become aware at some point of the Everest-like status of their native language, as they, from their privileged vantage point on the summit, observe foolhardy foreigners huffing and puffing up the steep slopes.",
"Everyone's heard the supposed fact that if you take the English idiom \"It's Greek to me\" and search for equivalent idioms in all the world's languages to arrive at a consensus as to which language is the hardest, the results of such a linguistic survey is that Chinese easily wins as the canonical incomprehensible language. (For example, the French have the expression \"C'est du chinois\", \"It's Chinese\", i.e., \"It's incomprehensible\". Other languages have similar sayings.) So then the question arises: What do the Chinese themselves consider to be an impossibly hard language? You then look for the corresponding phrase in Chinese, and you find Gēn tiānshū yíyàng 跟天书一样 meaning \"It's like heavenly script.\"",
"There is truth in this linguistic yarn; Chinese does deserve its reputation for heartbreaking difficulty. Those who undertake to study the language for any other reason than the sheer joy of it will always be frustrated by the abysmal ratio of effort to effect. Those who are actually attracted to the language precisely because of its daunting complexity and difficulty will never be disappointed. Whatever the reason they started, every single person who has undertaken to study Chinese sooner or later asks themselves \"Why in the world am I doing this?\" Those who can still remember their original goals will wisely abandon the attempt then and there, since nothing could be worth all that tedious struggle. Those who merely say \"I've come this far -- I can't stop now\" will have some chance of succeeding, since they have the kind of mindless doggedness and lack of sensible overall perspective that it takes.",
"Okay, having explained a bit of what I mean by the word, I return to my original question: Why is Chinese so damn hard?",
"1. Because the writing system is ridiculous.",
"Beautiful, complex, mysterious -- but ridiculous. I, like many students of Chinese, was first attracted to Chinese because of the writing system, which is surely one of the most fascinating scripts in the world. The more you learn about Chinese characters the more intriguing and addicting they become. The study of Chinese characters can become a lifelong obsession, and you soon find yourself engaged in the daily task of accumulating them, drop by drop from the vast sea of characters, in a vain attempt to hoard them in the leaky bucket of long-term memory.",
"The beauty of the characters is indisputable, but as the Chinese people began to realize the importance of universal literacy, it became clear that these ideograms were sort of like bound feet -- some fetishists may have liked the way they looked, but they weren't too practical for daily use.",
"For one thing, it is simply unreasonably hard to learn enough characters to become functionally literate. Again, someone may ask \"Hard in comparison to what?\" And the answer is easy: Hard in comparison to Spanish, Greek, Russian, Hindi, or any other sane, \"normal\" language that requires at most a few dozen symbols to write anything in the language. John DeFrancis, in his book The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy, reports that his Chinese colleagues estimate it takes seven to eight years for a Mandarin speaker to learn to read and write three thousand characters, whereas his French and Spanish colleagues estimate that students in their respective countries achieve comparable levels in half that time.2 Naturally, this estimate is rather crude and impressionistic (it's unclear what \"comparable levels\" means here), but the overall implications are obvious: the Chinese writing system is harder to learn, in absolute terms, than an alphabetic writing system.3 Even Chinese kids, whose minds are at their peak absorptive power, have more trouble with Chinese characters than their little counterparts in other countries have with their respective scripts. Just imagine the difficulties experienced by relatively sluggish post-pubescent foreign learners such as myself.",
"Everyone has heard that Chinese is hard because of the huge number of characters one has to learn, and this is absolutely true. There are a lot of popular books and articles that downplay this difficulty, saying things like \"Despite the fact that Chinese has [10,000, 25,000, 50,000, take your pick] separate characters you really only need 2,000 or so to read a newspaper\". Poppycock. I couldn't comfortably read a newspaper when I had 2,000 characters under my belt. I often had to look up several characters per line, and even after that I had trouble pulling the meaning out of the article. (I take it as a given that what is meant by \"read\" in this context is \"read and basically comprehend the text without having to look up dozens of characters\"; otherwise the claim is rather empty.)",
"This fairy tale is promulgated because of the fact that, when you look at the character frequencies, over 95% of the characters in any newspaper are easily among the first 2,000 most common ones.4 But what such accounts don't tell you is that there will still be plenty of unfamiliar words made up of those familiar characters. (To illustrate this problem, note that in English, knowing the words \"up\" and \"tight\" doesn't mean you know the word \"uptight\".) Plus, as anyone who has studied any language knows, you can often be familiar with every single word in a text and still not be able to grasp the meaning. Reading comprehension is not simply a matter of knowing a lot of words; one has to get a feeling for how those words combine with other words in a multitude of different contexts.5 In addition, there is the obvious fact that even though you may know 95% of the characters in a given text, the remaining 5% are often the very characters that are crucial for understanding the main point of the text. A non-native speaker of English reading an article with the headline \"JACUZZIS FOUND EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PHLEBITIS\" is not going to get very far if they don't know the words \"jacuzzi\" or \"phlebitis\".",
"The problem of reading is often a touchy one for those in the China field. How many of us would dare stand up in front of a group of colleagues and read a randomly-selected passage out loud? Yet inferiority complexes or fear of losing face causes many teachers and students to become unwitting cooperators in a kind of conspiracy of silence wherein everyone pretends that after four years of Chinese the diligent student should be whizzing through anything from Confucius to Lu Xun, pausing only occasionally to look up some pesky low-frequency character (in their Chinese-Chinese dictionary, of course). Others, of course, are more honest about the difficulties. The other day one of my fellow graduate students, someone who has been studying Chinese for ten years or more, said to me \"My research is really hampered by the fact that I still just can't read Chinese. It takes me hours to get through two or three pages, and I can't skim to save my life.\" This would be an astonishing admission for a tenth-year student of, say, French literature, yet it is a comment I hear all the time among my peers (at least in those unguarded moments when one has had a few too many Tsingtao beers and has begun to lament how slowly work on the thesis is coming).",
"A teacher of mine once told me of a game he and a colleague would sometimes play: The contest involved pulling a book at random from the shelves of the Chinese section of the Asia Library and then seeing who could be the first to figure out what the book was about. Anyone who has spent time working in an East Asia collection can verify that this can indeed be a difficult enough task -- never mind reading the book in question. This state of affairs is very disheartening for the student who is impatient to begin feasting on the vast riches of Chinese literature, but must subsist on a bland diet of canned handouts, textbook examples, and carefully edited appetizers for the first few years.",
"The comparison with learning the usual western languages is striking. After about a year of studying French, I was able to read a lot. I went through the usual kinds of novels -- La nausée by Sartre, Voltaire's Candide, L'étranger by Camus -- plus countless newspapers, magazines, comic books, etc. It was a lot of work but fairly painless; all I really needed was a good dictionary and a battered French grammar book I got at a garage sale.",
"This kind of \"sink or swim\" approach just doesn't work in Chinese. At the end of three years of learning Chinese, I hadn't yet read a single complete novel. I found it just too hard, impossibly slow, and unrewarding. Newspapers, too, were still too daunting. I couldn't read an article without looking up about every tenth character, and it was not uncommon for me to scan the front page of the People's Daily and not be able to completely decipher a single headline. Someone at that time suggested I read The Dream of the Red Chamber and gave me a nice three-volume edition. I just have to laugh. It still sits on my shelf like a fat, smug Buddha, only the first twenty or so pages filled with scribbled definitions and question marks, the rest crisp and virgin. After six years of studying Chinese, I'm still not at a level where I can actually read it without an English translation to consult. (By \"read it\", I mean, of course, \"read it for pleasure\". I suppose if someone put a gun to my head and a dictionary in my hand, I could get through it.) Simply diving into the vast pool of Chinese in the beginning is not only foolhardy, it can even be counterproductive. As George Kennedy writes, \"The difficulty of memorizing a Chinese ideograph as compared with the difficulty of learning a new word in a European language, is such that a rigid economy of mental effort is imperative.\"6 This is, if anything, an understatement. With the risk of drowning so great, the student is better advised to spend more time in the shallow end treading water before heading toward the deep end.",
"As if all this weren't bad enough, another ridiculous aspect of the Chinese writing system is that there are two (mercifully overlapping) sets of characters: the traditional characters still used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and the simplified characters adopted by the People's Republic of China in the late 1950's and early 60's. Any foreign student of Chinese is more or less forced to become familiar with both sets, since they are routinely exposed to textbooks and materials from both Chinas. This linguistic camel's-back-breaking straw puts an absurd burden on the already absurdly burdened student of Chinese, who at this point would gladly trade places with Sisyphus. But since Chinese people themselves are never equally proficient in both simplified and complex characters, there is absolutely no shame whatsoever in eventually concentrating on one set to the partial exclusion the other. In fact, there is absolutely no shame in giving up Chinese altogether, when you come right down to it.",
"2. Because the language doesn't have the common sense to use an alphabet.",
"To further explain why the Chinese writing system is so hard in this respect, it might be a good idea to spell out (no pun intended) why that of English is so easy. Imagine the kind of task faced by the average Chinese adult who decides to study English. What skills are needed to master the writing system? That's easy: 26 letters. (In upper and lower case, of course, plus script and a few variant forms. And throw in some quote marks, apostrophes, dashes, parentheses, etc. -- all things the Chinese use in their own writing system.) And how are these letters written? From left to right, horizontally, across the page, with spaces to indicate word boundaries. Forgetting for a moment the problem of spelling and actually making words out of these letters, how long does it take this Chinese learner of English to master the various components of the English writing system? Maybe a day or two.",
"Now consider the American undergraduate who decides to study Chinese. What does it take for this person to master the Chinese writing system? There is nothing that corresponds to an alphabet, though there are recurring components that make up the characters. How many such components are there? Don't ask. As with all such questions about Chinese, the answer is very messy and unsatisfying. It depends on how you define \"component\" (strokes? radicals?), plus a lot of other tedious details. Suffice it to say, the number is quite large, vastly more than the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet. And how are these components combined to form characters? Well, you name it -- components to the left of other components, to the right of other components, on top of other components, surrounding other components, inside of other components -- almost anything is possible. And in the process of making these spatial accommodations, these components get flattened, stretched, squashed, shortened, and distorted in order to fit in the uniform square space that all characters are supposed to fit into. In other words, the components of Chinese characters are arrayed in two dimensions, rather than in the neat one-dimensional rows of alphabetic writing.",
"Okay, so ignoring for the moment the question of elegance, how long does it take a Westerner to learn the Chinese writing system so that when confronted with any new character they at least know how to move the pen around in order to produce a reasonable facsimile of that character? Again, hard to say, but I would estimate that it takes the average learner several months of hard work to get the basics down. Maybe a year or more if they're a klutz who was never very good in art class. Meanwhile, their Chinese counterpart learning English has zoomed ahead to learn cursive script, with time left over to read Moby Dick, or at least Strunk & White.",
"This is not exactly big news, I know; the alphabet really is a breeze to learn. Chinese people I know who have studied English for a few years can usually write with a handwriting style that is almost indistinguishable from that of the average American. Very few Americans, on the other hand, ever learn to produce a natural calligraphic hand in Chinese that resembles anything but that of an awkward Chinese third-grader. If there were nothing else hard about Chinese, the task of learning to write characters alone would put it in the rogues' gallery of hard-to-learn languages.",
"3. Because the writing system just ain't very phonetic.",
"So much for the physical process of writing the characters themselves. What about the sheer task of memorizing so many characters? Again, a comparison of English and Chinese is instructive. Suppose a Chinese person has just the previous day learned the English word \"president\", and now wants to write it from memory. How to start? Anyone with a year or two of English experience is going to have a host of clues and spelling rules-of-thumb, albeit imperfect ones, to help them along. The word really couldn't start with anything but \"pr\", and after that a little guesswork aided by visual memory (\"Could a 'z' be in there? That's an unusual letter, I would have noticed it, I think. Must be an 's'...\") should produce something close to the target. Not every foreigner (or native speaker for that matter) has noted or internalized the various flawed spelling heuristics of English, of course, but they are at least there to be utilized.",
"Now imagine that you, a learner of Chinese, have just the previous day encountered the Chinese word for \"president\" (总统 zǒngtǒng ) and want to write it. What processes do you go through in retrieving the word? Well, very often you just totally forget, with a forgetting that is both absolute and perfect in a way few things in this life are. You can repeat the word as often as you like; the sound won't give you a clue as to how the character is to be written. After you learn a few more characters and get hip to a few more phonetic components, you can do a bit better. (\"Zǒng 总 is a phonetic component in some other character, right?...Song? Zeng? Oh yeah, cong 总 as in cōngmíng 聪明.\") Of course, the phonetic aspect of some characters is more obvious than that of others, but many characters, including some of the most high-frequency ones, give no clue at all as to their pronunciation.",
"All of this is to say that Chinese is just not very phonetic when compared to English. (English, in turn, is less phonetic than a language like German or Spanish, but Chinese isn't even in the same ballpark.) It is not true, as some people outside the field tend to think, that Chinese is not phonetic at all, though a perfectly intelligent beginning student could go several months without noticing this fact. Just how phonetic the language is a very complex issue. Educated opinions range from 25% (Zhao Yuanren)7 to around 66% (DeFrancis),8 though the latter estimate assumes more knowledge of phonetic components than most learners are likely to have. One could say that Chinese is phonetic in the way that sex is aerobic: technically so, but in practical use not the most salient thing about it. Furthermore, this phonetic aspect of the language doesn't really become very useful until you've learned a few hundred characters, and even when you've learned two thousand, the feeble phoneticity of Chinese will never provide you with the constant memory prod that the phonetic quality of English does.",
"Which means that often you just completely forget how to write a character. Period. If there is no obvious semantic clue in the radical, and no helpful phonetic component somewhere in the character, you're just sunk. And you're sunk whether your native language is Chinese or not; contrary to popular myth, Chinese people are not born with the ability to memorize arbitrary squiggles. In fact, one of the most gratifying experiences a foreign student of Chinese can have is to see a native speaker come up a complete blank when called upon to write the characters for some relatively common word. You feel an enormous sense of vindication and relief to see a native speaker experience the exact same difficulty you experience every day.",
"This is such a gratifying experience, in fact, that I have actually kept a list of characters that I have observed Chinese people forget how to write. (A sick, obsessive activity, I know.) I have seen highly literate Chinese people forget how to write certain characters in common words like \"tin can\", \"knee\", \"screwdriver\", \"snap\" (as in \"to snap one's fingers\"), \"elbow\", \"ginger\", \"cushion\", \"firecracker\", and so on. And when I say \"forget\", I mean that they often cannot even put the first stroke down on the paper. Can you imagine a well-educated native English speaker totally forgetting how to write a word like \"knee\" or \"tin can\"? Or even a rarely-seen word like \"scabbard\" or \"ragamuffin\"? I was once at a luncheon with three Ph.D. students in the Chinese Department at Peking University, all native Chinese (one from Hong Kong). I happened to have a cold that day, and was trying to write a brief note to a friend canceling an appointment that day. I found that I couldn't remember how to write the character 嚔, as in da penti 打喷嚔 \"to sneeze\". I asked my three friends how to write the character, and to my surprise, all three of them simply shrugged in sheepish embarrassment. Not one of them could correctly produce the character. Now, Peking University is usually considered the \"Harvard of China\". Can you imagine three Ph.D. students in English at Harvard forgetting how to write the English word \"sneeze\"?? Yet this state of affairs is by no means uncommon in China. English is simply orders of magnitude easier to write and remember. No matter how low-frequency the word is, or how unorthodox the spelling, the English speaker can always come up with something, simply because there has to be some correspondence between sound and spelling. One might forget whether \"abracadabra\" is hyphenated or not, or get the last few letters wrong on \"rhinoceros\", but even the poorest of spellers can make a reasonable stab at almost anything. By contrast, often even the most well-educated Chinese have no recourse but to throw up their hands and ask someone else in the room how to write some particularly elusive character.",
"As one mundane example of the advantages of a phonetic writing system, here is one kind of linguistic situation I encountered constantly while I was in France. (Again I use French as my canonical example of an \"easy\" foreign language.) I wake up one morning in Paris and turn on the radio. An ad comes on, and I hear the word \"amortisseur\" several times. \"What's an amortisseur?\" I think to myself, but as I am in a hurry to make an appointment, I forget to look the word up in my haste to leave the apartment. A few hours later I'm walking down the street, and I read, on a sign, the word \"AMORTISSEUR\" -- the word I heard earlier this morning. Beneath the word on the sign is a picture of a shock absorber. Aha! So \"amortisseur\" means \"shock absorber\". And voila! I've learned a new word, quickly and painlessly, all because the sound I construct when reading the word is the same as the sound in my head from the radio this morning -- one reinforces the other. Throughout the next week I see the word again several times, and each time I can reconstruct the sound by simply reading the word phonetically -- \"a-mor-tis-seur\". Before long I can retrieve the word easily, use it in conversation, or write it in a letter to a friend. And the process of learning a foreign language begins to seem less daunting.",
"When I first went to Taiwan for a few months, the situation was quite different. I was awash in a sea of characters that were all visually interesting but phonetically mute. I carried around a little dictionary to look up unfamiliar characters in, but it's almost impossible to look up a character in a Chinese dictionary while walking along a crowded street (more on dictionary look-up later), and so I didn't get nearly as much phonetic reinforcement as I got in France. In Taiwan I could pass a shop with a sign advertising shock absorbers and never know how to pronounce any of the characters unless I first look them up. And even then, the next time I pass the shop I might have to look the characters up again. And again, and again. The reinforcement does not come naturally and easily.",
"4. Because you can't cheat by using cognates.",
"I remember when I had been studying Chinese very hard for about three years, I had an interesting experience. One day I happened to find a Spanish-language newspaper sitting on a seat next to me. I picked it up out of curiosity. \"Hmm,\" I thought to myself. \"I've never studied Spanish in my life. I wonder how much of this I can understand.\" At random I picked a short article about an airplane crash and started to read. I found I could basically glean, with some guesswork, most of the information from the article. The crash took place near Los Angeles. 186 people were killed. There were no survivors. The plane crashed just one minute after take-off. There was nothing on the flight recorder to indicate a critical situation, and the tower was unaware of any emergency. The plane had just been serviced three days before and no mechanical problems had been found. And so on. After finishing the article I had a sudden discouraging realization: Having never studied a day of Spanish, I could read a Spanish newspaper more easily than I could a Chinese newspaper after more than three years of studying Chinese.",
"What was going on here? Why was this \"foreign\" language so transparent? The reason was obvious: cognates -- those helpful words that are just English words with a little foreign make-up.9 I could read the article because most of the operative words were basically English: aeropuerto, problema mechanico, un minuto, situacion critica, emergencia, etc. Recognizing these words as just English words in disguise is about as difficult as noticing that Superman is really Clark Kent without his glasses. That these quasi-English words are easier to learn than Chinese characters (which might as well be quasi-Martian) goes without saying.",
"Imagine you are a diabetic, and you find yourself in Spain about to go into insulin shock. You can rush into a doctor's office, and, with a minimum of Spanish and a couple of pieces of guesswork (\"diabetes\" is just \"diabetes\" and \"insulin\" is \"insulina\", it turns out), you're saved. In China you'd be a goner for sure, unless you happen to have a dictionary with you, and even then you would probably pass out while frantically looking for the first character in the word for insulin. Which brings me to the next reason why Chinese is so hard.",
"5. Because even looking up a word in the dictionary is complicated.",
"One of the most unreasonably difficult things about learning Chinese is that merely learning how to look up a word in the dictionary is about the equivalent of an entire semester of secretarial school. When I was in Taiwan, I heard that they sometimes held dictionary look-up contests in the junior high schools. Imagine a language where simply looking a word up in the dictionary is considered a skill like debate or volleyball! Chinese is not exactly what you would call a user-friendly language, but a Chinese dictionary is positively user-hostile.",
"Figuring out all the radicals and their variants, plus dealing with the ambiguous characters with no obvious radical at all is a stupid, time-consuming chore that slows the learning process down by a factor of ten as compared to other languages with a sensible alphabet or the equivalent. I'd say it took me a good year before I could reliably find in the dictionary any character I might encounter. And to this day, I will very occasionally stumble onto a character that I simply can't find at all, even after ten minutes of searching. At such times I raise my hands to the sky, Job-like, and consider going into telemarketing.",
"Chinese must also be one of the most dictionary-intensive languages on earth. I currently have more than twenty Chinese dictionaries of various kinds on my desk, and they all have a specific and distinct use. There are dictionaries with simplified characters used on the mainland, dictionaries with the traditional characters used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and dictionaries with both. There are dictionaries that use the Wade-Giles romanization, dictionaries that use pinyin, and dictionaries that use other more surrealistic romanization methods. There are dictionaries of classical Chinese particles, dictionaries of Beijing dialect, dictionaries of chéngyǔ (four-character idioms), dictionaries of xiēhòuyǔ (special allegorical two-part sayings), dictionaries of yànyǔ (proverbs), dictionaries of Chinese communist terms, dictionaries of Buddhist terms, reverse dictionaries... on and on. An exhaustive hunt for some elusive or problematic lexical item can leave one's desk \"strewn with dictionaries as numerous as dead soldiers on a battlefield.\"10",
"For looking up unfamiliar characters there is another method called the four-corner system. This method is very fast -- rumored to be, in principle, about as fast as alphabetic look-up (though I haven't met anyone yet who can hit the winning number each time on the first try). Unfortunately, learning this method takes about as much time and practice as learning the Dewey decimal system. Plus you are then at the mercy of the few dictionaries that are arranged according to the numbering scheme of the four-corner system. Those who have mastered this system usually swear by it. The rest of us just swear.",
"Another problem with looking up words in the dictionary has to do with the nature of written Chinese. In most languages it's pretty obvious where the word boundaries lie -- there are spaces between the words. If you don't know the word in question, it's usually fairly clear what you should look up. (What actually constitutes a word is a very subtle issue, of course, but for my purposes here, what I'm saying is basically correct.) In Chinese there are spaces between characters, but it takes quite a lot of knowledge of the language and often some genuine sleuth work to tell where word boundaries lie; thus it's often trial and error to look up a word. It would be as if English were written thus:",
"FEAR LESS LY OUT SPOKE N BUT SOME WHAT HUMOR LESS NEW ENG LAND BORN LEAD ACT OR GEORGE MICHAEL SON EX PRESS ED OUT RAGE TO DAY AT THE STALE MATE BE TWEEN MAN AGE MENT AND THE ACT OR 'S UNION BE CAUSE THE STAND OFF HAD SET BACK THE TIME TABLE FOR PRO DUC TION OF HIS PLAY, A ONE MAN SHOW CASE THAT WAS HIS FIRST RUN A WAY BROAD WAY BOX OFFICE SMASH HIT. \"THE FIRST A MEND MENT IS AT IS SUE\" HE PRO CLAIM ED. \"FOR A CENS OR OR AN EDIT OR TO EDIT OR OTHER WISE BLUE PENCIL QUESTION ABLE DIA LOG JUST TO KOW TOW TO RIGHT WING BORN AGAIN BIBLE THUMP ING FRUIT CAKE S IS A DOWN RIGHT DIS GRACE.\"",
"Imagine how this difference would compound the dictionary look-up difficulties of a non-native speaker of English. The passage is pretty trivial for us to understand, but then we already know English. For them it would often be hard to tell where the word boundaries were supposed to be. So it is, too, with someone trying to learn Chinese.",
"6. Then there's classical Chinese (wenyanwen).",
"Forget it. Way too difficult. If you think that after three or four years of study you'll be breezing through Confucius and Mencius in the way third-year French students at a comparable level are reading Diderot and Voltaire, you're sadly mistaken. There are some westerners who can comfortably read classical Chinese, but most of them have a lot of gray hair or at least tenure.",
"Unfortunately, classical Chinese pops up everywhere, especially in Chinese paintings and character scrolls, and most people will assume anyone literate in Chinese can read it. It's truly embarrassing to be out at a Chinese restaurant, and someone asks you to translate some characters on a wall hanging.",
"\"Hey, you speak Chinese. What does this scroll say?\" You look up and see that the characters are written in wenyan, and in incomprehensible \"grass-style\" calligraphy to boot. It might as well be an EKG readout of a dying heart patient.",
"\"Uh, I can make out one or two of the characters, but I couldn't tell you what it says,\" you stammer. \"I think it's about a phoenix or something.\"",
"\"Oh, I thought you knew Chinese,\" says your friend, returning to their menu. Never mind that an honest-to-goodness Chinese person would also just scratch their head and shrug; the face that is lost is yours.",
"Whereas modern Mandarin is merely perversely hard, classical Chinese is deliberately impossible. Here's a secret that sinologists won't tell you: A passage in classical Chinese can be understood only if you already know what the passage says in the first place. This is because classical Chinese really consists of several centuries of esoteric anecdotes and in-jokes written in a kind of terse, miserly code for dissemination among a small, elite group of intellectually-inbred bookworms who already knew the whole literature backwards and forwards, anyway. An uninitiated westerner can no more be expected to understand such writing than Confucius himself, if transported to the present, could understand the entries in the \"personal\" section of the classified ads that say things like: \"Hndsm. SWGM, 24, 160, sks BGM or WGM for gentle S&M, mod. bndg., some lthr., twosm or threesm ok, have own equip., wheels, 988-8752 lv. mssg. on ans. mach., no weirdos please.\"",
"In fairness, it should be said that classical Chinese gets easier the more you attempt it. But then so does hitting a hole in one, or swimming the English channel in a straitjacket.",
"7. Because there are too many romanization methods and they all suck.",
"Well, perhaps that's too harsh. But it is true that there are too many of them, and most of them were designed either by committee or by linguists, or -- even worse -- by a committee of linguists. It is, of course, a very tricky task to devise a romanization method; some are better than others, but all involve plenty of counterintuitive spellings.11 And if you're serious about a career in Chinese, you'll have to grapple with at least four or five of them, not including the bopomofu phonetic symbols used in Taiwan. There are probably a dozen or more romanization schemes out there somewhere, most of them mercifully obscure and rightfully ignored. There is a standing joke among sinologists that one of the first signs of senility in a China scholar is the compulsion to come up with a new romanization method.",
"8. Because tonal languages are weird.",
"Okay, that's very Anglo-centric, I know it. But I have to mention this problem because it's one of the most common complaints about learning Chinese, and it's one of the aspects of the language that westerners are notoriously bad at. Every person who tackles Chinese at first has a little trouble believing this aspect of the language. How is it possible that shùxué means \"mathematics\" while shūxuě means \"blood transfusion\", or that guòjiǎng means \"you flatter me\" while guǒjiàng means \"fruit paste\"?",
"By itself, this property of Chinese would be hard enough; it means that, for us non-native speakers, there is this extra, seemingly irrelevant aspect of the sound of a word that you must memorize along with the vowels and consonants. But where the real difficulty comes in is when you start to really use Chinese to express yourself. You suddenly find yourself straitjacketed -- when you say the sentence with the intonation that feels natural, the tones come out all wrong. For example, if you wish say something like \"Hey, that's my water glass you're drinking out of!\", and you follow your intonational instincts -- that is, to put a distinct falling tone on the first character of the word for \"my\" -- you will have said a kind of gibberish that may or may not be understood.",
"Intonation and stress habits are incredibly ingrained and second-nature. With non-tonal languages you can basically import, mutatis mutandis, your habitual ways of emphasizing, negating, stressing, and questioning. The results may be somewhat non-native but usually understandable. Not so with Chinese, where your intonational contours must always obey the tonal constraints of the specific words you've chosen. Chinese speakers, of course, can express all of the intonational subtleties available in non-tonal languages -- it's just that they do it in a way that is somewhat alien to us speakers of non-tonal languages. When you first begin using your Chinese to talk about subjects that actually matter to you, you find that it feels somewhat like trying to have a passionate argument with your hands tied behind your back -- you are suddenly robbed of some vital expressive tools you hadn't even been aware of having.",
"9. Because east is east and west is west, and the twain have only recently met.",
"Language and culture cannot be separated, of course, and one of the main reasons Chinese is so difficult for Americans is that our two cultures have been isolated for so long. The reason reading French sentences like \"Le président Bush assure le peuple koweitien que le gouvernement américain va continuer à défendre le Koweit contre la menace irakienne,\" is about as hard as deciphering pig Latin is not just because of the deep Indo-European family resemblance, but also because the core concepts and cultural assumptions in such utterances stem from the same source. We share the same art history, the same music history, the same history history -- which means that in the head of a French person there is basically the same set of archetypes and the same cultural cast of characters that's in an American's head. We are as familiar with Rimbaud as they are with Rambo. In fact, compared to the difference between China and the U.S., American culture and and French culture seem about as different as Peter Pan and Skippy peanut butter.",
"Speaking with a Chinese person is usually a different matter. You just can't drop Dickens, Tarzan, Jack the Ripper, Goethe, or the Beatles into a conversation and always expect to be understood. I once had a Chinese friend who had read the first translations of Kafka into Chinese, yet didn't know who Santa Claus was. China has had extensive contact with the West in the last few decades, but there is still a vast sea of knowledge and ideas that is not shared by both cultures.",
"Similarly, how many Americans other than sinophiles have even a rough idea of the chronology of China's dynasties? Has the average history major here ever heard of Qin Shi Huangdi and his contribution to Chinese culture? How many American music majors have ever heard a note of Peking Opera, or would recognize a pipa if they tripped over one? How many otherwise literate Americans have heard of Lu Xun, Ba Jin, or even Mozi?",
"What this means is that when Americans and Chinese get together, there is often not just a language barrier, but an immense cultural barrier as well. Of course, this is one of the reasons the study of Chinese is so interesting. It is also one of the reasons it is so damn hard.",
"Conclusion",
"I could go on and on, but I figure if the reader has bothered to read this far, I'm preaching to the converted, anyway. Those who have tackled other difficult languages have their own litany of horror stories, I'm sure. But I still feel reasonably confident in asserting that, for an average American, Chinese is significantly harder to learn than any of the other thirty or so major world languages that are usually studied formally at the university level (though Japanese in many ways comes close). Not too interesting for linguists, maybe, but something to consider if you've decided to better yourself by learning a foreign language, and you're thinking \"Gee, Chinese looks kinda neat.\"",
"It's pretty hard to quantify a process as complex and multi-faceted as language-learning, but one simple metric is to simply estimate the time it takes to master the requisite language-learning skills. When you consider all the above-mentioned things a learner of Chinese has to acquire -- ability to use a dictionary, familiarity with two or three romanization methods, a grasp of principles involved in writing characters (both simplified and traditional) -- it adds up to an awful lot of down time while one is \"learning to learn\" Chinese.",
"How much harder is Chinese? Again, I'll use French as my canonical \"easy language\". This is a very rough and intuitive estimate, but I would say that it takes about three times as long to reach a level of comfortable fluency in speaking, reading, and writing Chinese as it takes to reach a comparable level in French. An average American could probably become reasonably fluent in two Romance languages in the time it would take them to reach the same level in Chinese.",
"One could perhaps view learning languages as being similar to learning musical instruments. Despite the esoteric glories of the harmonica literature, it's probably safe to say that the piano is a lot harder and more time-consuming to learn. To extend the analogy, there is also the fact that we are all virtuosos on at least one \"instrument\" (namely, our native language), and learning instruments from the same family is easier than embarking on a completely different instrument. A Spanish person learning Portuguese is comparable to a violinist taking up the viola, whereas an American learning Chinese is more like a rock guitarist trying to learn to play an elaborate 30-stop three-manual pipe organ.",
"Someone once said that learning Chinese is \"a five-year lesson in humility\". I used to think this meant that at the end of five years you will have mastered Chinese and learned humility along the way. However, now having studied Chinese for over six years, I have concluded that actually the phrase means that after five years your Chinese will still be abysmal, but at least you will have thoroughly learned humility.",
"There is still the awe-inspiring fact that Chinese people manage to learn their own language very well. Perhaps they are like the gradeschool kids that Baroque performance groups recruit to sing Bach cantatas. The story goes that someone in the audience, amazed at hearing such youthful cherubs flawlessly singing Bach's uncompromisingly difficult vocal music, asks the choir director, \"But how are they able to perform such difficult music?\"",
"\"Shh -- not so loud!\" says the director, \"If you don't tell them it's difficult, they never know.\"",
